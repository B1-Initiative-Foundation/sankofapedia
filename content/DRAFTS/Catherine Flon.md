She is renowned for sewing the first Haitian flag on May 18, 1803, during the Congress of Arcahaie, where Jean-Jacques Dessalines, her godfather, removed the white band from the French tricolor, symbolizing the break from France. Flon stitched the remaining blue and red bands together, which in Haitian lore represented a union between the black and mulatto citizens of Haiti.While some historians have questioned the veracity of the story due to limited archival evidence, Flon's role has become an integral part of Haitian national memory, akin to Betsy Ross's role in American history. She is one of the three most symbolic heroines of Haitian independence, alongside Cécile Fatiman and Dédée Bazile. Her birthplace, Arcahaie, is known as "flag town," and May 18, the day she is said to have created the flag, is celebrated as a national holiday in Haiti. Flon's image was featured on a 10-Gourdes Haitian banknote issued in 2000, and she is remembered for her contributions to the Haitian Revolution and as a symbol of women's participation in the nation's history
