Max Roach was an American jazz drummer and composer, a pioneer of bebop, and one of the most influential and widely recorded modern percussionists. He grew up in New York City, where he played drums in gospel bands as a child. In the early 1940s, he began performing with innovative musicians at notable nightclubs, contributing to the development of bebop. Roach's innovative approach to drumming, particularly his use of the ride cymbal for timekeeping, set new standards for jazz percussion.He was part of the historic Massey Hall concert in 1953 and co-led a quintet with trumpeter Clifford Brown until Brown's untimely death in 1956. Roach was known for his political activism, reflected in works like "We Insist! Freedom Now Suite." He formed the all-percussion ensemble M'Boom and collaborated with a wide range of artists, from avant-garde musicians to classical string quartets.Roach continued to tour and perform into the early 21st century and composed music for various art forms. He received numerous honors, including a MacArthur Foundation grant, and was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame. His legacy is celebrated in the documentary "Max Roach: The Drum Also Waltzes," which premiered at South by Southwest and was broadcast on PBS's American Masters series
