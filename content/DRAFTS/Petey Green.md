Petey Greene was a pioneering Black media personality, community organizer, and civil rights activist. Overcoming drug addiction and a prison sentence for armed robbery, he became one of the most prominent media personalities in Washington, D.C. Greene hosted "Rappin' with Petey Greene" on radio and "Petey Greene's Washington" on television, winning two Emmy Awards for his work. He was known for his candid discussions on various social issues, including structural inequality and systemic racism. Greene's early life included a year in juvenile detention for setting fire to a tree, an act he later reflected on with a critical view of the justice system. His career took off after his release from prison in 1965, quickly becoming a successful host and an influential figure in the community. Greene's legacy includes his autobiography, "Laugh If You Like, Ain't a Damn Thing Funny," and his portrayal by Don Cheadle in the 2007 film "Talk to Me." He passed away from liver cancer in 1984, leaving behind a significant impact on broadcasting and civil rights activism
