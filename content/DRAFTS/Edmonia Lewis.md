Orphaned at an early age, she grew up in her mother's tribe and later pursued education, which led her to Oberlin College. After leaving Oberlin due to a racially charged incident, she moved to Boston and established herself as a professional artist, studying with a local sculptor and creating portraits of famous antislavery heroes.In 1865, Lewis moved to Rome, where she became involved with a group of American women sculptors and began to work in marble. Unlike many sculptors of her time, Lewis did all her own stonework to ensure her work was accepted as original. Her works often dealt with themes related to her African American and Native American heritage and the oppression of Black people.Lewis's most famous work, "The Death of Cleopatra," was exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1876. After a successful career, she became more reclusive, and little is known about her last decades. Her work can now be found in some of the most important American museums, including the Howard University Gallery of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, and the Baltimore Museum of Art
