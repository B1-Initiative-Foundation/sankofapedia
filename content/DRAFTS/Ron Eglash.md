Ron Eglash is an author and researcher who has investigated fractals in African architecture, traditional hairstyling, textiles, sculpture, painting, carving, metalwork, religion, games, practical craft, quantitative techniques, and symbolic systems. His work explores the presence of fractal geometry in African culture and its contrast to European and American design themes. Eglash's book "African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design" discusses the political and social implications of African fractal geometry and makes a unique contribution to the study of mathematics, African culture, anthropology, and computer simulations. He has also given a TED talk on the fractals at the heart of African designs
