Claude McKay was a Jamaican-American writer and poet, a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance, and a vocal advocate for civil rights. He was educated by his brother and influenced by the works in Walter Jekyll's library. McKay's early poetry, including "Songs of Jamaica" and "Constab Ballads," was written in Jamaican dialect. He moved to the United States in 1912, where he continued his education and began to write about social and political concerns from his perspective as a Black man.McKay's notable works include "Harlem Shadows," which contributed to the Harlem Renaissance, and the poem "If We Must Die," which is a defiant statement against racial violence. He published several poetry collections and novels, such as "Home to Harlem," "Banjo," and "Banana Bottom." McKay's work ranged from vernacular verse celebrating peasant life in Jamaica to poems and novels that protested racial and economic injustices.In the 1920s, McKay developed interests in Communism and social justice, traveling to the Soviet Union and throughout Europe and North Africa. Despite his radical associations, he remained a romantic at heart, influenced by his Jamaican upbringing. Later in life, McKay converted to Catholicism and wrote about his experiences in Harlem. He died in Chicago in 1948, and posthumously, previously unpublished works like "Amiable with Big Teeth" were discovered and published
