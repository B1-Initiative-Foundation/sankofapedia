Hannibal Barca was a Carthaginian general, considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. His name, Hannibal, is believed to mean "Grace of Baal" and reflects his Carthaginian heritage. Hannibal is best known for his role in the Second Punic War against Rome, particularly for his audacious crossing of the Alps with a diverse army and war elephants.Despite facing logistical challenges and the grudging support from Carthage, Hannibal maintained a highly disciplined and loyal army composed of North Africans, Iberians, and Gauls. His military campaigns in Italy remained undefeated for over a decade, showcasing his tactical genius, notably at the Battle of Cannae.Hannibal's legacy is complex; while Roman sources, which are the primary accounts of his life, acknowledge his military genius, they also criticize him for alleged cruelty and perfidy. Modern historians recognize his strategic skills and his efforts to secure Carthage's position in the Mediterranean against Rome's expanding influence.After Carthage's defeat in the Second Punic War, Hannibal continued to be involved in politics and later military advising in the Eastern Mediterranean until his death, which was by suicide to avoid capture by the Romans
