George wears his hair in locs, a style that led to his suspension from school for most of the 2023-2024 school year. School officials claimed his hairstyle violated the district's dress code, which regulates the length of boys' hair, stating it cannot extend past the eyebrows or ear lobes.The case garnered significant attention due to its implications for the CROWN Act, a law prohibiting race-based hair discrimination, which Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law in May 2023. Despite the CROWN Act's protections for hairstyles like braids, locs, and twists, a Texas judge ruled that the school district's suspension of George did not violate the Act. The judge's decision was based on the argument that the CROWN Act does not specifically mention hair length. George's suspension and the subsequent legal battle have sparked a broader conversation about race-based hair discrimination and the interpretation of the CROWN Act in schools. The controversy has drawn support for George from across the country, including public figures and civil rights advocates. George's family, represented by attorney Allie Booker, has filed both a formal complaint with the Texas Education Agency and a civil rights lawsuit against Texas officials, arguing that the school district's policy and its enforcement against George violate his rights under the CROWN Act
