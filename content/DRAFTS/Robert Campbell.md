Robert Campbell was a Jamaican-born emigrant from the United States to Nigeria, known for his efforts to establish a colony of black Americans in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Initially working as a printer, he later became a science teacher and assistant principal at the Institute for Colored Youth in Philadelphia. In 1858, Campbell joined Martin R. Delany on the Niger Valley Exploring Party to find a suitable site for the settlement of black Americans in West Africa. They traveled the region in 1859â€“60 and signed a treaty with local chiefs to secure land for a settlement.Campbell's writings, including "A Few Facts Relating to Lagos, Abeokuta and Other Sections of Central Africa" and "A Pilgrimage to My Motherland," outlined his vision for the prospective emigrants to promote legitimate commerce and undermine slavery and the slave trade. He also hoped that the emigrants would act as missionaries, bringing a "black nationality" to the traditionally European missionary work. Despite his plans, the settlement project did not materialize, partly due to the American Civil War and opposition from British colonial leaders.Campbell settled in Lagos, where he established The Anglo-African newspaper, the first to be published in Lagos. His work contributed to the development of the colony commercially and intellectually
