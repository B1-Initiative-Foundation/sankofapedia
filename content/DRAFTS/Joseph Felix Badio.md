Joseph Félix Badio emerged as a key suspect in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse, which occurred on July 7, 2021. Badio, a former Justice Ministry official, was implicated in the assassination after a team of Colombian hitmen, arrested shortly after Moïse's killing, told Haitian authorities they had received the order from him. Badio was fired from his position at the Haitian government’s Anti-Corruption Unit on May 17, prior to the assassination, due to serious breaches in professional conduct. An arrest warrant issued by the Port-au-Prince prosecutor’s office accused Badio of murder and armed robbery against President Moïse.The investigation into Moïse's assassination has been sprawling and ongoing, involving multiple countries and supported by both the US FBI and Colombian intelligence services. At least 39 people have been implicated in the killing. Badio was arrested in Haiti on October 20, 2023, marking a significant development in the case. His arrest was confirmed by National Police spokesman Garry Desrosiers, and he was apprehended while grocery shopping in a popular supermarket in Petionville
