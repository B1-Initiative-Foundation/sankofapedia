Constantine the Great was the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity and played a crucial role in the spread of Christianity in Europe. He is known for issuing the Edict of Milan in 313 AD, which proclaimed religious tolerance for Christianity within the Roman Empire. Constantine also convened the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD, which was the first effort to attain consensus in the church through an assembly representing all of Christendom. As a military leader, Constantine won several important battles, including the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 AD, where he claimed to have seen a vision of the Christian cross, which led to his conversion. He founded the city of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), which later became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire and a center of Christian culture. Constantine's reign marked a significant turning point for the Roman Empire, the impact of which was felt in many areas of life, from religion to administration, and his legacy continues to influence both secular and religious history.
