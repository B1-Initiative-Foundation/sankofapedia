Pope Benedict XIV, born Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini, served as the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 1740 until his death in 1758. He is remembered as one of the most learned and enlightened popes of his time, contributing significantly to church law through his writings and decrees.Regarding the issue of slavery, Pope Benedict XIV issued the papal bull _Immensa Pastorum_ on December 20, 1741. This document condemned the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas and reiterated the Church's opposition to the transatlantic slave trade. _Immensa Pastorum_ built upon the efforts of previous popes to address and condemn the injustices of slavery, particularly in the newly colonized lands. Benedict XIV's pontificate was marked by a commitment to intellectual and ecclesiastical reform. He promoted the sciences and arts, made contributions to various fields of knowledge, and worked to improve the administration of the Papal States. His efforts in reforming the Church and its practices, as well as his stance on issues like slavery, reflect his broader vision for a Church engaged with the world and its challenges
