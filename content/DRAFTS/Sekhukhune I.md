King Sekhukhune I was the paramount King of the Marota, more commonly known as the Bapedi (Pedi people), from September 21, 1861, until his assassination on August 13, 1882, by his rival and half-brother, Mampuru II. As the Pedi paramount leader, he faced political challenges from Voortrekkers (Boer settlers), the independent South African Republic (Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek), the British Empire, and considerable social change caused by Christian missionaries. Following the death of his father, King Sekwati, Sekhukhune successfully defended his right to the throne against Mampuru II. He was known for his military and diplomatic skills, which he used to consolidate power and resist European encroachment. His reign marked a significant period in the history of the Pedi people and their resistance to colonialism
