Karl Marx was a German-born philosopher, economist, political theorist, historian, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. His most influential works are "The Communist Manifesto" (co-authored with Friedrich Engels) and the three-volume "Das Kapital."

He is considered one of the principal architects of modern social science and his work has been both lauded and criticized. Marxism has influenced socialist thought, political movements, and revolutionary governments throughout the 20th century, with various theoretical variants such as Leninism, Marxismâ€“Leninism, Trotskyism, and Maoism being developed from his ideas
