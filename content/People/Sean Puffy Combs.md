Sean "Puffy" Combs, also known by various other names including Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, Diddy, and Love (which he legally made his middle name in 2021), is a multifaceted American music mogul, rapper, producer, actor, and entrepreneur. He launched his music production company, Bad Boy Entertainment, in 1993, working with iconic artists like Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige, and Biggie Smalls. Following Biggie's murder in 1997, Combs recorded the tribute "I’ll be Missing You," which became a chart-topping hit and propelled his debut album "No Way Out" to platinum status and a Grammy Award. Beyond music, Combs has made significant strides in fashion with his Sean John apparel line, acted in various film and television roles, and ventured into reality TV and the spirits industry with his tequila brand. His entrepreneurial ventures have made him one of the wealthiest figures in hip-hop, with Forbes estimating his net worth at approximately $555 million. Combs' career has not been without controversy, including legal issues and allegations of abuse. Despite these challenges, he has continued to influence the music industry and beyond, with his latest album "The Love Album: Off the Grid" earning a Grammy nomination in 2024 for Best Progressive R&B Album
