She has been involved in the literary examination of themes such as nationalism, exile, and African cultural identity. Her collection "My Motherâ€™s Poem and Other Songs" is noted for its investment in orature and performance and reflects on nationalism and exile, challenging the hegemonic construction of home as a stable category[1]. She has also been associated with Ngugi wa Thiong'o in the play "The Trial of Dedan Kimathi"[8].
