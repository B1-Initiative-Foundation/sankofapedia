Muammar Gaddafi was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist who ruled Libya as its primary leader from 1969 to 2011. After leading a coup that overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in 1969, Gaddafi established the Libyan Arab Republic and later the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. His rule was characterized by the implementation of a form of direct democracy based on his political philosophy outlined in the "Green Book," though in practice, Libya was an authoritarian state under his control.Gaddafi's foreign policy was marked by pan-Africanism, pan-Arabism, and support for various liberation movements worldwide. He was known for his support of anti-imperialist organizations and was accused of sponsoring terrorism, which led to Libya's international isolation in the 1980s and 1990s. Gaddafi's regime was also criticized for human rights abuses, including the suppression of political dissent.In 2011, during the Arab Spring, a civil war broke out in Libya. Gaddafi was eventually captured and killed by rebel forces in his hometown of Sirte in October 2011, ending his 42-year rule. His death marked the end of the Gaddafi regime, but Libya has since been plagued by instability and conflict.
