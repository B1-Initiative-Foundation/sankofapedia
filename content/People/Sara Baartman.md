Sara Baartman, also known as the "Hottentot Venus," was a woman from the Khoekhoe group in South Africa who was exhibited in London and Paris in the early 19th century due to her physical features, particularly her buttocks. Her life and death have been the subject of numerous studies, discussions, and controversies. After her death, her body was dissected and her remains were displayed in a museum in Paris. In 2002, after a long campaign that involved Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, her remains were returned to South Africa and reburied[1][4]. Specific details such as her date of birth, place of birth, education, spouses, children, and parents' names are not readily available in the public domain.
