# Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, is a figure of immense historical significance, known for his leadership during the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. This biography aims to provide a comprehensive overview of his life, drawing on peer-reviewed studies, published works, and reputable scholarly sources.

## Personal Life

Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in a log cabin in Hardin County, Kentucky. He was the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln. His early life was marked by hardship and frontier challenges, including the death of his mother when he was just nine years old. Lincoln's formal education was sporadic, amounting to less than a year in total, but he was an avid reader and largely self-educated.

In 1832, Anson Gordon Henry, a close friend and political ally of Lincoln, moved to Springfield, Illinois. Henry, who had a medical background, shared a deep bond with Lincoln, rooted in their shared political ambitions and personal struggles. This friendship lasted throughout their lives, highlighting the personal connections that shaped Lincoln's character and career[19].

Lincoln married Mary Todd on November 4, 1842. The couple had four sons, only one of whom, Robert Todd Lincoln, survived into adulthood. Lincoln's family life was complex and sometimes strained, particularly due to the pressures of his political career and the tragic deaths of his children.

## Career

Lincoln's professional life began in manual labor, but he quickly transitioned into law and politics. He was admitted to the bar in 1836 and began practicing law in Springfield, Illinois. Lincoln's legal career was marked by his logical reasoning, persuasive oratory, and a strong moral compass, which earned him respect and recognition[20][18][11].

Politically, Lincoln was initially a member of the Whig Party before becoming a key figure in the founding of the Republican Party in the 1850s. His political career included terms in the Illinois State Legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. Lincoln's debates with Stephen Douglas in 1858, though he lost the Senate race, propelled him to national prominence and set the stage for his presidential candidacy[9].

## Achievements

Lincoln's presidency, from 1861 to 1865, was dominated by the Civil War. His leadership during this tumultuous period was characterized by a steadfast commitment to preserving the Union and a deep moral conviction against slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, declared the freedom of all slaves in Confederate-held territory, a pivotal step towards the abolition of slavery in the United States.

Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered on November 19, 1863, is one of the most famous speeches in American history, encapsulating the war's purpose and envisioning a future of unity and freedom.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Despite his revered status, Lincoln's views and policies have been the subject of debate and criticism. Some critics argue that his approach to slavery was pragmatic rather than purely moralistic, driven by political considerations and the goal of preserving the Union. Additionally, his suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War has been controversial, viewed by some as an overreach of executive power.
