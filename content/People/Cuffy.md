## Brief Biography
[[Cuffy]], an Akan man from West Africa, was captured and enslaved to work on the plantations in the Dutch colony of Berbice, present-day [[Guyana]]. In 1763, he led a major slave revolt involving over 3,800 slaves against the colonial regime. Cuffy became the leader of the revolt, named himself Governor of Berbice, and established order with the assistance of another slave named Akara. Unfortunately, infighting between the revolutionaries and a military response from the Dutch ultimately led to Cuffy's death. Today, he is considered a national hero in [[Guyana]], and the country celebrates Republic Day on February 23rd to mark the anniversary of the slave rebellion[1][3].
