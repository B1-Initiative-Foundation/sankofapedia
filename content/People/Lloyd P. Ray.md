Lloyd P. Ray was an African American inventor known for his invention of the improved dustpan. On August 3, 1897, Ray was granted U.S. Patent No. 587,607 for a device he described as a "Dust Pan." This invention was significant because it allowed for more efficient and hygienic collection of dust and debris, featuring a long handle that eliminated the need for users to bend over to sweep up dust. The design of Ray's dustpan included a metal collection plate attached to a wooden handle, which was a considerable improvement over the short-handled pans that were common at the time. While specific details about Ray's life, including his birth, education, and family, are not widely documented, his contribution to everyday household tools has had a lasting impact. The concept of a long-handled dustpan continues to influence the design of modern cleaning tools, making Ray's invention a noteworthy example of African American innovation during a period when such contributions were often overlooked or marginalized. Ray's dustpan represents not only a practical solution to a common problem but also a historical milestone in the recognition of African American inventors and their role in shaping everyday life.
