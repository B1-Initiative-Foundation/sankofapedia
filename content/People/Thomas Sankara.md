## Legacy
[[Thomas Sankara]] was a Burkinabé military captain, Marxist revolutionary, pan-Africanist theorist, and President of [[Burkina Faso]] from 1983 to 1987[4]. Born in [[Yako]], French Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Sankara was a charismatic and iconic figure of revolution, often referred to as "Africa's Che Guevara"[4]. He launched ambitious social, economic, and environmental programs during his time in power[4]. Sankara's policies focused on reducing government corruption, promoting national sovereignty, and building self-sufficiency[4]. His legacy continues to inspire activists and political movements across [[Africa]][5].

## Early Life and Military Career

Thomas Sankara was born on December 21, 1949, in Yako, Upper Volta, which is now known as Burkina Faso. His parents, of Roman Catholic faith, had aspirations for him to become a priest, but Sankara chose a military career instead. He attended officer training in Madagascar, where he was exposed to various political ideologies and witnessed a popular uprising. Sankara also trained at a parachute academy in France before returning to Upper Volta in 1972[1].

## Rise to Power

Sankara's military prowess and charismatic leadership led to his popularity and subsequent political appointments. However, his integrity and political stance often put him at odds with the leadership of successive military governments, resulting in his arrest on several occasions. In January 1983, he became the prime minister of the newly formed Council for the Salvation of the People but was removed and arrested in May of the same year. On August 4, 1983, Sankara was freed and installed as the president of Burkina Faso by a coup led by his close friend Blaise Compaoré[1].

## Presidency and Reforms

As president, Sankara embarked on ambitious programs to transform Burkina Faso. He fought environmental degradation, empowered women, and increased access to education and health care. His government planted 10 million trees to combat desertification and boosted literacy rates and school attendance. Sankara also changed the country's name to Burkina Faso, meaning "land of upright people," and implemented policies to reduce infant mortality and increase the number of women in government[1][2].

Sankara's domestic policies included agrarian self-sufficiency, land reform, and a nationwide literacy campaign. He vaccinated 2.5 million children against diseases and was known for his anti-imperialist foreign policies, rejecting foreign aid and pushing for odious debt reduction. His administration also focused on promoting public health and environmental sustainability[2].

## Assassination and Legacy

Despite his achievements, Sankara's administration faced growing dissent and internal conflict. On October 15, 1987, he was assassinated in a coup led by Compaoré. Decades later, in 2021, 14 people were charged in relation to Sankara's death, including Compaoré, who was tried in absentia and sentenced to life in prison in 2022[1].

Sankara's legacy continues to inspire many for his revolutionary policies, personal integrity, and dedication to the upliftment of Burkina Faso. His speeches and writings, such as "Thomas Sankara Speaks" and "Women’s Liberation and the African Freedom Struggle," remain influential[1].
