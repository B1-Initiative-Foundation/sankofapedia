Cherrelle, born Cheryl Anne Norton, is an American R&B singer and songwriter who gained fame in the mid-1980s. Her career took off after being discovered by Tabu Records founder Clarence Avant and signing with the label. Under the production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Cherrelle released her debut album "Fragile" in 1984, which included the top 10 R&B single "I Didn't Mean to Turn You On." She is also known for her duets with R&B singer Alexander O'Neal, including hits like "Saturday Love" and "Never Knew Love Like This," as well as "Always" with her cousin Pebbles. Cherrelle's music career includes several successful albums, such as "High Priority" in 1985 and "Affair" in 1988, the latter featuring the Number 1 R&B single "Everything I Miss at Home." Her work has been covered by artists like Robert Palmer and Mariah Carey, and "Saturday Love" is celebrated as one of the greatest soul duets in history. Despite a departure from Jam and Lewis productions with her album "The Woman I Am" in 1991, she reunited with the producers for "The Right Time" in 1999. Cherrelle continues to perform and has left a lasting impact on the R&B genre
