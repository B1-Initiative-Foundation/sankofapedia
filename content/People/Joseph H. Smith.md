Joseph H. Smith was an African American inventor known for his significant contributions to gardening and agriculture through the invention of the lawn sprinkler. On May 4, 1897, Smith patented his first lawn sprinkler, later making improvements to the original design. His invention has had a lasting impact, making it easier to water lawns, gardens, and crops, especially in large areas. Smith's work with the lawn sprinkler, including a rotary-head design patented in 1897, has been instrumental in aiding crop growth even in drought conditions and improving yields in regular years for over 125 years. Despite the importance of his inventions, not much is known about his personal life, including his parents or if he had any children. Smith was born into slavery, which makes his achievements even more remarkable given the historical context and the barriers he would have faced
