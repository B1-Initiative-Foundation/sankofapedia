Harvey Bernard Gantt is an American architect and politician known for his contributions to civil rights and urban development. As a politician, Gantt served as the first African American mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina, from 1983 to 1987, after serving on the Charlotte City Council. His mayoral tenure was marked by a focus on revitalizing the city's downtown area and expanding its economic base. Gantt's political career also includes two historic but unsuccessful campaigns for the United States Senate in 1990 and 1996 against incumbent Republican Jesse Helms. These races drew national attention due to their racial dynamics and the progressive nature of Gantt's campaign. In addition to his political work, Gantt has had a significant impact on the field of architecture. He co-founded Gantt Huberman Architects, which has been responsible for the design of many important structures in Charlotte and beyond. Gantt's legacy includes his pioneering role as a student at Clemson University, where he was the first African American admitted, and his ongoing advocacy for social justice and community development.
