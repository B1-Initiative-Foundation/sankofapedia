## Role in History
Jean-Jacques Dessalines was a key figure in the [[Haitian Revolution]]. He played a significant role in the fight for Haiti's independence and was the first ruler of an independent Haiti under the 1805 constitution[2].

## Early Life
Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (Haiti). He was originally given the name Duclos, after the plantation’s owner, and later adopted the surname Dessalines after the free black landowner who purchased him and freed him[3].

## Legacy
Dessalines is revered as one of the founding fathers of Haiti, having declared the country independent and ruled as its emperor for two years. His legacy is controversial due to his authoritarian rule and the brutal measures taken during his governance[5].

Jean-Jacques Dessalines' life is a mix of legend and history. While Haitian tradition suggests he was born in West Africa, most historians believe he was born in Saint-Domingue. He rose from a brutal life as a slave to become a prominent leader in the fight for Haiti's independence[4].

## Death
Dessalines was assassinated on October 17, 1806, possibly in an ambush led by his former allies [Alexandre Pétion] and [Henri Christophe], who later split the country in two and ruled each section separately[4].
