Lamar Whitehead is a well-known religious and community leader from the US, particularly recognized for founding the Leaders of Tomorrow International Churches in March 2014. He gained national attention for his extravagant displays of wealth and his involvement in various controversies, including a viral incident where he was seen grabbing and pushing a woman during a church service. Whitehead has been in the news for a lawsuit he launched against YouTube over the release of a video capturing this event, seeking $40 million in damages. Before his religious career, Whitehead worked as a mortgage broker. He holds certifications as a marriage and funeral officiant and a New York State Chaplain license. His lifestyle, marked by a significant wardrobe and travel in a Rolls-Royce, contrasts with his humble beginnings in Brooklyn's Canarsie neighborhood. Whitehead also ventured into politics, running for Brooklyn Borough President in 2021. In December 2022, Whitehead faced federal charges for fraud schemes, including wire fraud, extortion, and making material false statements to the FBI. These charges allege that he swindled a parishioner out of $90,000 of her retirement savings, among other accusations. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 65 years in prison. Despite these legal challenges, Whitehead maintains his innocence and continues to be a polarizing figure in the public eye, with a net worth estimated to be between $1-2 million
