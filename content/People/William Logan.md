Rev. William Logan was a significant figure in the Shiloh community and worked at the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina. He earned $50 a month supervising Black work crews as a foreman. His crews were responsible for maintaining roads on the estate grounds, cleaning streets in Biltmore Village, and working in the forests. After his death in 1921, his son Zeke continued the work. Rev. William Logan's contributions to the Biltmore Estate and the Shiloh community are a testament to the important roles that African Americans played in the development and maintenance of such historic properties. His work and leadership helped shape the landscape and infrastructure of the Biltmore Estate, which is now a prominent tourist attraction and a testament to the Gilded Age.
