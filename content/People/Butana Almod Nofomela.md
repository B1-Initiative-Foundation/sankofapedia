Butana Almond Nofomela is known for his involvement in the Vlakplaas, a secret apartheid-era counter-insurgency unit of the South African Police. He confessed to his involvement in political assassinations while on death row for a separate murder conviction. His confession in 1989 exposed the existence of state-sanctioned death squads and led to the establishment of the Harms Commission of Inquiry into hit squads. However, the commission was widely criticized for its failure to uncover the truth about the death squads. Nofomela's revelations were later corroborated by other Vlakplaas operatives, leading to further investigations by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
