Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who is widely considered one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century. He developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work also laid the foundation for the study of quantum mechanics and the understanding of atomic energy. Einstein's most famous equation is �=��2E=mc2, which expresses the idea that mass and energy are interchangeable. This equation was a groundbreaking step in the development of nuclear energy and had profound implications for the structure of the universe. In 1921, Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in establishing the quantum theory. Despite the immense success of his work on relativity, Einstein spent much of his later years attempting to unify the forces of the universe into a single theory, a quest that remained unfulfilled at the time of his death. Einstein's contributions to science extended beyond his theoretical work; he was also known for his support of civil rights, his pacifism, and his advocacy for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. After fleeing Nazi Germany, Einstein settled in the United States, where he continued his research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, until his death in 1955
