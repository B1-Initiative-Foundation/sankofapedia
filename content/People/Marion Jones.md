Marion Jones was a former world champion track-and-field athlete and professional basketball player. She won three gold medals and two bronze medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. However, Jones was later stripped of her medals after admitting to steroid use, becoming one of the most famous athletes linked to the BALCO scandal. Jones was a standout high school athlete and later a star on the University of North Carolina's women's basketball team, leading them to an NCAA Championship in 1994. She returned to track and field, winning gold medals at the World Championships before setting her sights on the Sydney Olympics, where she aimed to win five gold medals. After her track and field career, Jones played professional basketball for the Tulsa Shock in the WNBA. Her athletic accomplishments were overshadowed by her involvement in the doping scandal, for which she served a six-month prison sentence for perjury related to her steroid use
