Carl Lewis is one of the most celebrated athletes in track and field history. He is one of only four Olympic athletes to have won nine Olympic gold medals, and his career spanned from 1979 to 1996. Lewis dominated multiple events, including the 100-meter dash, the 200-meter dash, and the long jump, and he achieved significant durations of success, winning four consecutive gold medals in the long jump. Lewis's Olympic debut was at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, where he matched Jesse Owens' 1936 feat by winning four gold medals in the 100m, 200m, long jump, and 4x100m relay. He continued to excel in subsequent Olympics, defending his long jump title and winning additional golds in the 100m and 4x100m relay. Despite his athletic prowess, Lewis faced challenges with public perception and endorsements post-Olympics. He was also a trailblazer in advocating for the professionalization of track and field athletes. After retiring from competition, Lewis has been involved in coaching at the University of Houston and continues to be a prominent figure in athletics.Â His legacy as an athlete is marked by his exceptional talent, his advocacy for athletes' rights, and his contributions to the sport of track and field
