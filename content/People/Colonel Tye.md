## Brief Biography
[[Colonel Tye]], born as [[Titus Cornelius]] around 1753, was a slave of African descent in the Province of [[New Jersey]]. He was one of four slaves owned by [[Quaker]] [[John Corlies]] from [[Shrewsbury]], [[Monmouth County]], [[New Jersey]]. Tye escaped from slavery during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and joined the British forces. He quickly gained respect for his military skills and was given the honorary title of Colonel. He led the [[Black Brigade]], a group of Loyalist raiders, conducting raids and assassinations across [[New Jersey]]. Tye's intimate knowledge of the local area was a valuable asset to the British forces. He died in 1780 from tetanus and lockjaw resulting from a gunshot wound[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].
