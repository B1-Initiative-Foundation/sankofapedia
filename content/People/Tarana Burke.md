Tarana Burke is a civil rights activist from The Bronx, New York, who is best known for founding the Me Too movement. In 2006, Burke began using the phrase "Me Too" to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society. The phrase and movement gained global recognition in 2017 when it was popularized as a hashtag by actress Alyssa Milano in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. Burke's activism is rooted in her own experiences and her desire to help other women, particularly young women of color, who have survived sexual violence. She has spent her career supporting survivors and working under the banner of social justice to combat sexual violence and other issues affecting marginalized people. As the Senior Director at Girls for Gender Equity in Brooklyn, Burke continues to advocate for survivors and work towards policy changes that will dismantle systems of oppression and inequality. Her work with the Me Too movement has been recognized internationally, and she has been honored with numerous awards and accolades for her contributions to social justice and gender equality. Burke's leadership and advocacy have made her an influential voice in the fight against sexual violence and for women's rights.
