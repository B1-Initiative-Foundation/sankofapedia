O.J. Simpson, also known as "The Juice," is a former American football running back who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers. Simpson's football career was highly decorated; he won the Heisman Trophy in 1968 while at USC and was the first NFL player to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a season, a feat he accomplished in 1973 with the Bills.Simpson was a two-time unanimous All-American in college and was selected first overall in the 1969 AFL-NFL Common Draft by the Buffalo Bills. He played for the Bills from 1969 to 1977 and finished his career with the 49ers from 1978 to 1979. Over his career, Simpson had 2,404 rushing attempts, 11,236 rushing yards, and 61 rushing touchdowns. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985.After retiring from football, Simpson worked as a sports commentator and actor, appearing in films such as "The Naked Gun" series. However, his life took a dramatic turn when he was tried for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1994. Simpson was acquitted in the criminal trial but was later found liable in a civil trial.Simpson's later years saw further legal troubles, including a conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping in 2008, for which he served time in prison before being released on parole in 2017. Despite his off-field issues, Simpson's on-field achievements remain a significant part of NFL history
