## Personal Life

[[Malcolm X]], originally named Malcolm Little, was born on May 19, 1925, in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], to [[Louise Little]] (née Norton), a multilingual seamstress, and [[Earl Little]], a Baptist preacher and handyman. His parents were active followers of [[Marcus Garvey]], with Earl serving as an organizer for Garvey’s [[United Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA) in the Midwest. The family faced significant racial harassment due to their activism, leading to their relocation across several states. Tragedy struck early in Malcolm's life with the violent death of his father in 1931, believed to be the work of white supremacists, and the subsequent institutionalization of his mother in 1939 due to mental health issues. These events led to Malcolm and his siblings being placed in foster homes or with family members[3].

Malcolm excelled in school but faced discouragement from pursuing his aspirations by a teacher, leading him to drop out and eventually move to [[Boston]] to live with his half-sister, [[Ella Little-Collins]]. In Boston and later in [[Harlem]], [[New York]], he became involved in various illegal activities, which culminated in his imprisonment in 1946 (3)(7)

In 1958, Malcolm married [[Betty Shabazz]], and the couple had six daughters, including twins born after Malcolm's assassination in 1965[18].

## Career

Malcolm X's career as a civil rights leader began during his imprisonment when he was introduced to the teachings of the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI) by his siblings. Upon his release in 1952, he became an active member of the NOI, adopting the name Malcolm X, and quickly rose to become a minister and national spokesperson for the organization. He was instrumental in increasing the NOI's membership and establishing new mosques across the [[United States]] [1]  [4].

Malcolm X became known for his eloquent and fiery speeches that advocated for black self-reliance, racial pride, and the defense of black communities against white aggression "by any means necessary." His advocacy extended beyond the NOI's teachings, as he emphasized the importance of education and economic empowerment for [[African Americans]][2][4].

After a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in 1964, Malcolm X's views evolved to include a more inclusive perspective on race and he founded the [[Muslim Mosque, Inc]], but he also founded the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] (OAAU), aimed at building self-reliant solutions for [[African Descendants]] [4].

## Achievements

Malcolm X's legacy includes his significant contributions to the civil rights movement and the spread of [[Islam]] among [[African Americans]]. He was a key figure in popularizing the NOI and played a crucial role in articulating the frustrations and aspirations of [[African Americans]] during the 1950s and 1960s. His autobiography, co-authored with [[Alex Haley]], remains an influential work that offers insight into his life, beliefs, and the racial dynamics of his time[4].

Malcolm X's emphasis on black nationalism, self-determination, and international solidarity among oppressed peoples has had a lasting impact on various movements for social justice and equality. His speeches and writings continue to inspire activists and scholars[14].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Malcolm X's relationship with [[Martin Luther King Jr]] and his stance on violence have been subjects of controversy and misunderstanding. Contrary to the portrayal of Malcolm as advocating violence, he emphasized self-defense in the face of aggression. His criticisms of King's nonviolent approach evolved over time, and before his death, Malcolm expressed a willingness to work alongside civil rights leaders for shared goals [5]  [15].

Recent research has revealed that a famous criticism of Malcolm X by [[Martin Luther King Jr]] was largely falsified, showing that King was more open-minded about Malcolm than previously thought. This discovery challenges the narrative of a deep divide between the two leaders [22].
