## Brief Biography
[[Katherine Johnson]], born on August 26, 1918, in [[White Sulphur Springs]], [[West Virginia]], was an American mathematician who played a crucial role in calculating and analyzing the flight paths of many spacecraft during her more than three decades with the U.S. space program. She began her career with the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) in 1952 and later worked for NASA. Johnson's work contributed to the success of the Apollo 11 mission, which landed astronauts on the moon and returned them safely to Earth. She received numerous awards and honors for her work, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] in 2015. In 2016, her story was depicted in the movie "Hidden Figures," and NASA named the [[Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility]] in her honor[1][2][3][4][5].
