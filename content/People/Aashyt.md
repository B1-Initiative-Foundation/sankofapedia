## Personal Life

Ashayet was an ancient Egyptian queen consort, married to Mentuhotep II, a pharaoh of the 11th Dynasty. Her tomb and a small decorated chapel were discovered within the Deir el-Bahari temple complex, a site associated with Mentuhotep II's extensive burial complex. The discovery of her shrine, alongside the tombs of four other women in their twenties and a young girl, highlights the significance of these individuals in the royal court. The women buried alongside Ashayet were Henhenet, Kawit, Kemsit, Sadeh, and Mayet. It is suggested that there might have been three additional shrines that were destroyed during expansions of the burial complex. The burial site's location, sacred to Hathor from the Old Kingdom onwards, underscores the religious significance of these figures, particularly as most of them bore queenly titles and were Priestesses of Hathor.

## Career

Ashayet's career is closely tied to her religious roles within the ancient Egyptian court. She held several prestigious titles, including King's Beloved Wife (ḥmt-nỉswt mrỉỉ.t=f), King's Sole Ornament (ẖkr.t-nỉswt wˁtỉ.t), and multiple titles as a Priestess of Hathor, indicating her prominent position in religious practices. Her titles as a Priestess of Hathor, especially being described as "great of kas, foremost in her places" and "Lady of Dendera," suggest a significant role in the cult of Hathor, a major deity associated with love, beauty, music, and motherhood.

## Achievements

Ashayet's most notable achievements are reflected in the honors bestowed upon her in death, indicating her esteemed status in life. Her stone sarcophagus, known for its exquisite exterior relief and painted interior, along with a wooden coffin and statue found within her tomb, are significant artifacts that underscore her importance. The painted interior of her sarcophagus, which includes depictions of two Medjay women, Federtyt and Mekhenet, as part of her household, suggests Ashayet's high social standing and possibly her Nubian elite background. These artifacts, now housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, serve as a testament to her legacy.

## Significance of Burial Site and Titles

The burial site at Deir el-Bahari, sacred to Hathor, and the titles held by Ashayet, highlight her significant religious and possibly political role in ancient Egyptian society. As a Priestess of Hathor, Ashayet would have been involved in the rituals and ceremonies dedicated to the goddess, playing a crucial role in the religious life of the court and the wider community. Her titles, emphasizing her closeness to the king and her leadership within the cult of Hathor, reflect the respect and reverence she commanded both in life and in death.

In summary, Ashayet's life and legacy offer valuable insights into the roles of royal women and priestesses in ancient Egyptian society, particularly during the 11th Dynasty. Her burial within the prestigious Deir el-Bahari complex, alongside other notable women, underscores the significance of these individuals in the religious and political spheres of ancient Egypt.
