Cetshwayo kaMpande was the king of the Zulu Kingdom from 1873 to 1879 and is best known for leading the Zulu nation to victory against the British at the Battle of Isandlwana. He was crowned in a ceremony attended by Theophilus Shepstone, then Secretary for Native Affairs in the colony of Natal[1]. Cetshwayo's reign ended with the British invasion of the Zulu Kingdom and his subsequent capture during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879[6][7]. Despite the lack of specific personal details such as his birth date, place of birth, education, and family information, Cetshwayo kaMpande remains a significant figure in Zulu and South African history.
