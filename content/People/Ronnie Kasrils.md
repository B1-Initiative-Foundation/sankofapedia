Ronnie Kasrils is a South African former politician and anti-apartheid activist. He served as a military commander for the African National Congress (ANC) and later as an intelligence minister in South Africa. His work focused on the struggle against apartheid, examining the interplay between violent and non-violent forms of resistance. He was instrumental in the development of the political underground in South Africa, which, along with the armed struggle, played a significant role in ending apartheid. Kasrils also participated in political negotiations in South Africa from 1990 to 1994[3]. He has written about his experiences in his autobiography, "Armed and Dangerous: My Undercover Struggle Against Apartheid"[8].
