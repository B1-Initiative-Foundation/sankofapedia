George Franklin Grant was an African American dentist and inventor. He is best known for inventing and patenting the modern wooden golf tee. Grant patented his invention on December 12, 1899, under U.S. Patent No. 638,920. His design featured a peg with a rubber top, which made it easier for golfers to hit the ball without the need to prop it up on the ground or use sand mounds. In addition to his contributions to the sport of golf, Grant was also notable for being the second African American graduate of Harvard Dental School and the first African American faculty member at Harvard University. He was a respected dentist and an active member of the Boston community, where he worked to improve dental care access for underprivileged populations. Grant's invention of the golf tee has had a lasting impact on the game of golf, although he did not commercialize the invention during his lifetime. His legacy is recognized in the history of sports and the advancement of African American professionals in academia and medicine.
