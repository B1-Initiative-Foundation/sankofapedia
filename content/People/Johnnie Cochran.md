Johnnie Cochran was an American attorney best known for his leadership role in the defense and criminal acquittal of O.J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.

After completing his education, he began his legal career in Los Angeles as a deputy attorney for the city's criminal division, eventually moving into private practice where he gained a reputation for taking on cases involving police misconduct against African Americans.Throughout his career, Cochran became known for his skillful courtroom strategies and memorable phrases, such as "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit," during the O.J. Simpson trial. Despite controversies surrounding some of his cases, Cochran was celebrated for his contributions to civil rights and his efforts to challenge systemic racism within the legal system.Cochran's legacy continues through The Cochran Firm, which specializes in personal injury, wrongful death, and medical malpractice cases.
