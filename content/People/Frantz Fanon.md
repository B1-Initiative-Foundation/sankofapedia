Frantz Omar Fanon was a Francophone Afro-Caribbean psychiatrist, political philosopher, and Marxist. He was born on the island of Martinique under French colonial rule. Fanon is known for his theory that some neuroses are socially generated and for his critiques that influenced subsequent generations of thinkers and activists. His notable works include "The Wretched of the Earth" and "Black Skin, White Masks." Fanon's observations of the effects of colonial violence on the human psyche led him to work with the Algerian liberation movement. He served as an editor of its newspaper and was appointed ambassador to Ghana by Algeria's FLN-led provisional government. Fanon passed away on December 6, 1961, in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.
