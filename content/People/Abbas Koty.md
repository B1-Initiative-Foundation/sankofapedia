## Personal Life

Abbas Koty was born in 1952 and was a member of the Zaghawa Kobé tribe. His family had connections to the Sultan of Iriba, indicating a notable social standing within his community[3].

## Career

Koty's professional journey was deeply intertwined with Chad's tumultuous political landscape. Initially, he served as the Director of the Military Cabinet under Head of State Goukouni Oueddei from 1979 until June 1982. Following Oueddei's ousting by Hissène Habré, Koty went into exile in Nigeria. Despite his opposition to Habré, Koty returned to Chad in 1985 as part of a national reconciliation effort. By 1986, he was appointed as chargé d'affaires to Sudan, a position he held until 1988[1].

His political career took a significant turn when he joined the Patriotic Salvation Movement (MPS) and became a member of its Political Bureau. The MPS's ascension to power in December 1990 saw Koty being promoted to colonel and appointed as the army chief of staff. In May 1991, he was named Minister of Defense, Veterans, and War Victims under President Idriss Déby. However, by December 1991, he transitioned to the role of Minister of Public Works and Transport[1][4]. Koty's influence within the MPS was further solidified when he was elected to the party's Executive Committee, overseeing defense and security[1].

## Achievements

Koty's political and military career was marked by his significant roles within the government and the MPS. His appointments as Minister of Defense and later as Minister of Public Works and Transport underscore his contributions to Chad's governance during a critical period of its history[1][4].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

In June 1992, Koty was implicated in a coup attempt against the government, leading to his flight into exile in Cameroon. There, he co-founded the National Committee for Recovery (CNR) and was elected its president in November 1992[1]. Despite signing peace agreements with the government in 1993, Koty's life came to a tragic end on October 22, 1993, when he was shot and killed by security forces in N'Djamena. The government claimed he was plotting a coup and had resisted arrest[2][7][8], but the CNR and a U.S. State Department human rights report suggested his death was politically motivated, casting doubt on the official narrative[2].
