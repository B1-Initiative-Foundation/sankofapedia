Hendrik Witbooi is recognized as an iconic figure in the anti-colonial resistance against German colonialism in Namibia and as an inspiration for the liberation movement in Southern Africa. For many Namibians, Witbooi symbolizes the first struggle against German colonialism. During his time, German contemporaries viewed him as one of many tribal leaders to be manipulated and eliminated. Today, in Namibia, he is celebrated as one of the most important and renowned national heroes, commemorated at Heroes Acre in Windhoek[1]. His diaries and letters from 1884 to 1894 provide valuable insights into his leadership and resistance against colonial forces[2][3]. Witbooi's writings reveal his strategic use of assimilation and resistance against colonial discursive practices, including the employment of an 'exodus theme' as a rhetorical strategy to mobilize his people against German authorities[4][5]. The return of looted heirlooms, such as Witbooi's bible and riding whip, from Germany to Namibia in 2019 sparked controversy and highlighted the complexities of postcolonial state identity and historical experience[6].
