Marian Anderson was a celebrated American contralto and one of the most revered singers of the twentieth century. She is renowned for her wide-ranging repertoire, which included opera, spirituals, and lieder. Anderson's career was marked by a series of groundbreaking achievements, such as becoming the first African American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City in 1955. Her performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1939, after being denied the opportunity to sing at Constitution Hall by the Daughters of the American Revolution due to her race, became an iconic moment in civil rights history. Anderson was also the first African American to sign with RCA Victor Recording Company and to solo with the New York Philharmonic. She received numerous awards and honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963
