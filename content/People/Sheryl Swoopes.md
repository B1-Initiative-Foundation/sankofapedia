## Personal Life

Sheryl Denise Swoopes was born on March 25, 1971, in Brownfield, Texas. She was raised by her single mother, Louise Swoopes, after her father left the family shortly after her birth. Growing up, Sheryl played basketball with her three older brothers, which helped her develop an aggressive and physical playing style that became her trademark throughout her career. She attended Brownfield High School, where she led her team to a state championship and was recognized as an All-State and All-America athlete. Swoopes was also named Texas Player of the Year while still a junior[14].

Swoopes initially enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin on a scholarship but left due to homesickness and transferred to South Plains Junior College, closer to her hometown. After a successful stint there, she transferred to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, where she would make her mark in collegiate basketball[14].

In her personal life, Swoopes married her high school sweetheart, Eric Jackson, in June 1995, and they welcomed their son, Jordan Eric Jackson. The couple divorced in 1999. In 2005, Swoopes made headlines when she announced that she was in a relationship with Alisa Scott, an assistant coach of the Houston Comets, revealing that she was bisexual. The couple broke up in 2011, and later that year, Swoopes became engaged to Chris Unclesho. She and her husband, Chris Tellison, enjoy gardening and homesteading together, and they have turned their passion into a nonprofit called "Back to Our Roots"[16][18].

## Career

Swoopes's career has been defined by record-breaking accomplishments. After graduating from Texas Tech University, she was named the National Player of the Year by eight different organizations. She made history as the first player to sign with the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) and led the Houston Comets to three consecutive championships. Swoopes has been named to the All-WNBA First Team multiple times and is a three-time Olympian, earning gold medals at the 1996, 2000, and 2004 Olympic Games[19].

Swoopes was also a trailblazer in the WNBA, being the first player to have a Nike shoe named after her, the "Air Swoopes." She has been inducted into the Texas Tech University Hall of Fame and has received numerous awards, including the WNBA’s Most Valuable Player and Defensive Player of the Year. She was also named one of Houston’s Living Legends[19].

## Achievements

Swoopes's achievements extend beyond the basketball court. She educates and empowers children through the Sheryl Swoopes Foundation for Youth and serves on the Board of Judges for the Talbots Charitable Foundation’s Women’s Scholarship Fund. She co-authored a book entitled "Bounce Back," sharing her personal story of triumph and encouraging others to overcome adversity. Swoopes has been inducted into the Texas Tech University Hall of Fame, voted the WNBA’s Most Valuable Player, and received an ESPY for Female Professional Basketball Player of the Year[19].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

While Swoopes has been a role model and pioneer in women's basketball, her career has not been without controversy. In 2016, after ten players on her team at Loyola University Chicago were transferred or released from their scholarships, an investigation ensued in which Swoopes was accused of mistreatment. On July 4, 2016, Loyola University Chicago fired her as a result of the investigation[12].
