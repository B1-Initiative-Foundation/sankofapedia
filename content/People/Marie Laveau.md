Marie Laveau was a Louisiana Creole practitioner of Voodoo, renowned in New Orleans. She was a free woman of color and part Choctaw. Laveau was a hairdresser catering to wealthy white and Creole women, which allowed her to gather a network of informants. She also worked as a nurse, which included minor surgery and caring for the sick in her own home, as well as ministering to prisoners on death row. Laveau entered into a common-law marriage with Louis Christophe Dumesnil de Glapion after her first husband, Jacques Paris, disappeared. She lived with Glapion until his death and had fifteen children, though only two reached adulthood. Known as the "Voodoo Queen of New Orleans," Laveau was a respected and feared figure who led a multiracial religious community. She was a devout Catholic, attending mass daily, and integrated her Catholic faith with African traditional beliefs. Laveau's work in Voodoo was both spiritual and practical, as she offered consultations and held ceremonies. Despite her association with Voodoo, she was remembered as one of the kindest women who ever lived, dedicating much of her later life to charitable works
