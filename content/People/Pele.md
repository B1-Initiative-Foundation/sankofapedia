Pelé, born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time. He began his professional career with Santos FC at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. Throughout his career, Pelé was known for his incredible skill, scoring ability, and sportsmanship on the field. He played in four FIFA World Cups with Brazil, winning three (1958, 1962, and 1970) and remains the only player to achieve this feat. Pelé scored a total of 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, including friendlies, recognized as a Guinness World Record. Pelé's impact extended beyond the pitch; he was a global ambassador for football and engaged in various humanitarian efforts. After retiring, he continued to be involved in football as an honorary president of the New York Cosmos and contributed to the sport's growth worldwide. Pelé's legacy is celebrated in the Museu Pelé in Santos, which displays memorabilia from his storied career
