[[Khakheperre Senusret II]], also known as [[Senwosret II]], was the fourth pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty of Egypt. He ruled from 1897 BC to 1878 BC. His reign is marked by economic prosperity, characterized by agricultural growth and increased trade. He took a great deal of interest in the Faiyum oasis region and began work on an extensive irrigation project to increase the amount of cultivable land in that area. He also oversaw the construction of his pyramid complex and the city of workers in the Lahun area, which are considered to be his most significant internal works.
