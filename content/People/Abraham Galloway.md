## Early Life and Escape from Slavery

Abraham H. Galloway (1837-1870) was born into slavery in Smithville (now Southport), North Carolina. His father was a white man, and his mother was an enslaved woman. Galloway's early life was marked by the harsh realities of slavery, but little is known about his childhood and early years. What is clear, however, is that Galloway possessed a spirit of resistance and determination from a young age. In his early twenties, Galloway managed to escape from slavery, making his way to Canada via the Underground Railroad. This daring escape marked the beginning of Galloway's lifelong commitment to fighting against slavery and injustice.

## Role in the Civil War

During the Civil War, Galloway emerged as a significant figure in the Union's efforts to recruit black soldiers. By April 1863, the United States Army was actively recruiting black soldiers, and Galloway played a pivotal role in recruiting efforts near the Freedman’s Colony of Roanoke Island, North Carolina. He negotiated terms under which black recruits were willing to serve, including proper pay, subsistence for their families, education for their children, and honorable treatment as prisoners of war. Despite the Confederate States of America's policy of treating captured black soldiers as runaway slaves, Galloway's efforts contributed to approximately 5,000 black North Carolinians, most of whom were former slaves, joining the Union's cause. Galloway's contributions to the Union war effort extended beyond recruitment. He worked as a scout and spy, utilizing his knowledge of the South to gather intelligence for the Union Army. His activities were not without risk; Galloway frequently operated behind enemy lines, where capture could have meant death or re-enslavement.

## Political Activism and Legacy

After the war, Galloway continued his fight for equality and justice. He was a radical abolitionist who stood at the forefront of an African American political movement in Union-occupied North Carolina. Galloway's leadership and advocacy led to a historic delegation of black southerners meeting with President Abraham Lincoln at the White House, where they demanded full rights of citizenship. Galloway's political career reached a new height when he was elected as one of the first black men to the North Carolina legislature. In this role, he continued to advocate for the rights and welfare of African Americans during the tumultuous Reconstruction era. Galloway's efforts during this period were part of a broader struggle for African American rights and representation in the post-Civil War South.

## Conclusion

Abraham Galloway's life was marked by a relentless struggle against slavery and injustice. From his daring escape from bondage to his efforts to recruit black soldiers for the Union Army, and his post-war political activism, Galloway's legacy is that of a tireless fighter for freedom and equality. His story, long hidden from history, offers a unique perspective on the Civil War and Reconstruction as experienced by African Americans in the South. Galloway's life and work remind us of the contributions of African Americans to the fight for their own freedom and rights, challenging the traditional narratives of the Civil War and its aftermath.
