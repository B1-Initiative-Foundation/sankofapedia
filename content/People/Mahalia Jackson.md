Mahalia Jackson, often referred to as the "Queen of Gospel," was an American gospel singer renowned for her rich, powerful voice and her influence on gospel, R&B, soul, and rock and roll music. She began singing as a child at Mount Moriah Baptist Church in New Orleans and continued her singing career after moving to Chicago at the age of 16. Jackson's recording of "Move On Up a Little Higher" sold millions of copies, making it the most successful gospel single at the time. Jackson was the first gospel singer to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1950 and had a significant role in the civil rights movement, performing at the March on Washington in 1963 before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech. She also sang at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration and at Dr. King's funeral in 1968. Throughout her career, Jackson received multiple Grammy Awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award, and was posthumously inducted into both the Gospel Music Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her legacy continues to inspire musicians and listeners worldwide
