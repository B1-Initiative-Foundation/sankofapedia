Gloria Jones is an American singer and songwriter, best known for recording the original version of "Tainted Love," which later became a worldwide hit for the British synthpop duo Soft Cell. Jones began her career as a songwriter for Motown, penning hits for artists such as The Supremes. In the 1970s, she became closely associated with glam rock artist Marc Bolan and the band T. Rex, contributing as a keyboardist and singer. She was also Bolan's partner, and they had a son together, Roland Bolan. Jones' work with T. Rex expanded her influence in the music industry, and she continued to be involved in music production and performance after Bolan's untimely death in a car accident in 1977, in which she was driving. Despite facing personal tragedy, Jones has maintained a presence in the music world, both through her own work and through preserving Bolan's legacy. Her contributions to soul, R&B, and rock music have solidified her status as an influential figure in the development of these genres.
