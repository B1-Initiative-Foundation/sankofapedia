[[Mariama Bâ]] was a Senegalese author and women's rights advocate. She was born in 1929 in Senegal and was orphaned at an early age, being raised by her maternal grandparents. Despite attending school, she was still expected to perform traditional tasks at home. As a young high school student at the Ecole Normale Superieure, she wrote her first published work, which focused on colonial education in Senegal. She did not publish another piece until "So Long A Letter," a book that won the Noma Award for Literature. This was followed by "Scarlet Song," which was published posthumously. Bâ was known for her commitment to women's rights and her critique of the patriarchal society of Senegal. Her works often highlighted the struggles of Senegalese women and the societal pressures they faced[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].
