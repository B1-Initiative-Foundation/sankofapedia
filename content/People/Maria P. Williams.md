Maria P. Williams was a pioneering African-American woman in the early film industry, credited as the first African-American woman film producer for her work on the silent crime drama "The Flames of Wrath" in 1923.  Before her venture into filmmaking, Williams had a diverse career as a teacher, activist, director, filmmaker, author, and newspaper editor. She served as editor-in-chief of the Kansas City weekly "New Era" and later founded, wrote, and edited her own newspaper, the "Women's Voice," which was sponsored by the "colored women's auxiliary" of the Republican party. In addition to her work in journalism and activism, Williams co-managed a movie theater with her husband, Jesse L. Williams, which gave the couple experience in the distribution and release of films for African-American audiences. Together, they founded the Western Film Producing Co. and Booking Exchange. Williams wrote the script for "The Flames of Wrath," produced the film, and played the role of prosecuting attorney in the five-reel film. Tragically, Williams' life ended in murder in 1932 when she was called away from her home by a stranger under the pretense of needing help for his ill brother. She was later found shot to death on the side of a road several miles from her home. The murder remains unsolved. Despite the tragic end to her life and the loss of much of her film work, Maria P. Williams' legacy as a trailblazer in the film industry and her contributions to African-American culture and activism are remembered and celebrated.
