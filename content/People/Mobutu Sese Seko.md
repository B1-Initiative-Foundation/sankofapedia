Mobutu Sese Seko, born Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, was a Congolese politician and military officer who served as the President of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) from 1965 to 1997. He seized power in a 1965 coup and ruled for some 32 years, establishing a one-party state with the Popular Movement of the Revolution (Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution; MPR) as the country’s only legal party until 1990. Mobutu's rule was characterized by a strong personal dictatorship, a pervasive cult of personality, and widespread corruption, leading to the term "kleptocracy" being frequently associated with his governance. He amassed a significant personal fortune while the country's infrastructure and economy deteriorated. In January 1972, he changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Koko Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, which translates to "The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake". Mobutu's regime was supported by Western countries during the Cold War due to his anti-communist stance. However, with the end of the Cold War, he lost much of this support. Facing internal rebellions, economic decline, and increased international pressure for democratic reforms, Mobutu's regime eventually crumbled. In May 1997, he was ousted by rebel forces led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila and went into exile in Morocco, where he died later that year. Despite his controversial rule, Mobutu played a significant role in shaping the post-colonial history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and remains a prominent figure in discussions about African politics and governance
