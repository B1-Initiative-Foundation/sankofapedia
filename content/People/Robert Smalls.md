Robert Smalls was born into slavery and became a notable figure in American history for his heroic actions during the Civil War. He gained fame for commandeering a Confederate transport ship, the CSS Planter, in Charleston harbor and sailing it to freedom beyond the Confederate blockade. Smalls' act of bravery and skill not only secured his own freedom but also that of his family and the other enslaved crew members aboard the ship. Following the Civil War, Smalls continued to break barriers, serving in various public service roles, including as a member of the United States Congress[3][4][6][7][8].
