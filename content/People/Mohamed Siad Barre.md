Born into a nomadic family from the Marehan clan of the Daarood clan group. Mohamed Siad Barre was a Somali military general and the third president of Somalia, ruling from 1969 until 1991. He came to power following a military coup that ousted the elected government, establishing a socialist state and ruling as a dictator. Barre's regime was characterized by the promotion of a form of scientific socialism, which combined elements of Marxism with the teachings of the Quran, and efforts to modernize and industrialize Somalia. Barre's rule saw the nationalization of major industries and the implementation of significant social reforms, including the creation of a new writing system for the Somali language and campaigns for literacy and public health. However, his tenure was also marked by widespread human rights abuses, including the suppression of political opposition, and the use of clan-based violence. The late 1970s and 1980s saw growing resistance to Barre's rule, culminating in a civil war that led to his ousting in 1991. Following his departure, Somalia descended into a prolonged period of conflict and instability, from which it has struggled to recover. Barre spent his final years in exile in Nigeria, where he died in 1995. His legacy remains controversial, with some crediting him for efforts to develop Somalia, while others condemn his authoritarian rule and the violence and division it fostered
