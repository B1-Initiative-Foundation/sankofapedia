Raised primarily by his maternal grandmother in a household with many family members, he moved to St. Louis with his mother and siblings in 1994 seeking better opportunities and a safer environment. Yah'ki took an early interest in science, music, math, and astrology, excelling in science and mathematics. However, his life took a turn when he became involved with street life and gangs, leading to his incarceration in 2009.During his time in prison, Yah'ki's mother gifted him a preacher's Bible, which led to a significant change in his outlook on life. After his release, he embraced his role as a healer, educating many on spiritual lessons from the Bible and teaching himself the Hebrew alphabet in 48 hours. He has taught weekly spiritual lessons to a congregation in St. Louis and worldwide via YouTube.
