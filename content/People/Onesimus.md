Note: Onesimus was an enslaved African man in the early 18th century in Boston, Massachusetts. He is known for his contributions to the development of a smallpox inoculation technique during a smallpox epidemic in Boston in 1721. His knowledge of the procedure, which he shared with his enslaver, Cotton Mather, was instrumental in curbing the spread of the disease. However, due to the lack of records, many details about his life, including his birth and death dates, place of birth and death, education, and family, remain unknown.
