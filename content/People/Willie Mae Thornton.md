Willie Mae "Big Mama" Thornton was an American rhythm and blues singer and songwriter. She was the first to record the hit song "Hound Dog" in 1952, which later became famous when covered by Elvis Presley. Thornton's powerful voice and commanding stage presence earned her the nickname "Big Mama." She was also known for her song "Ball 'n' Chain," which Janis Joplin later popularized.Thornton's career began in the 1940s, and she quickly became a notable figure in the blues genre, performing with fellow blues artists and influencing future rock and roll musicians. Despite her influence, she did not gain the same level of fame or financial success as some of her contemporaries and those she influenced. Thornton was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1984, the same year she passed away. Her legacy is remembered for her contributions to the development of rock and roll and her role as a pioneering woman in the blues music scene.
