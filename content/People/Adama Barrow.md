## Personal Life

Adama Barrow was born on February 16, 1965, in Mankamang Kunda, a small village near Basse in the Upper River Region of The Gambia. Details about his early life, including his parents and schooling, are not extensively documented in the provided sources. However, it is known that Barrow moved to the capital city, Banjul, where he attended secondary school. His journey for further education and work led him to London, United Kingdom, where he studied for real estate qualifications while working as a security guard to support his studies.

## Career

Before entering politics, Adama Barrow had a career in real estate. He was a businessman and realtor, which provided him with a foundation to enter the political arena. His political career began to gain prominence when he was elected as the leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP) in 2016. Shortly after, he was chosen as the opposition coalition candidate to contest in the presidential elections against the long-standing incumbent, Yahya Jammeh. Barrow won the December 2016 presidential election, marking a significant turning point in The Gambia's political landscape. His victory was seen as the end of Jammeh's 22-year rule, which had been characterized by allegations of human rights abuses and suppression of political dissent.

## Achievements

One of Adama Barrow's most notable achievements is his contribution to The Gambia's democratic transition. His election victory in 2016 and the peaceful transfer of power that followed (despite initial resistance from Jammeh) were hailed as a triumph for democracy in the country and the region. Under his leadership, The Gambia has made efforts to address past human rights violations through initiatives like the transitional justice project. Furthermore, The Gambia has taken a stand in international human rights advocacy, notably launching proceedings against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice, alleging genocide. This move has been interpreted as an effort to re-establish The Gambia's reputation as a small-state leader in human rights.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Adama Barrow's presidency has not been without controversy. Initially, he had promised to serve a transitional term of three years before holding new elections. However, he later decided to complete a full five-year term, leading to protests and political unrest. This decision was seen by some as a betrayal of the agreement made with the coalition that supported his candidacy against Jammeh. Despite these controversies, Barrow has continued to assert his commitment to democracy and governance reforms.
