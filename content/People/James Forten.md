## Brief Biography
[[Categories/People/James Forten]], born on September 2, 1766, in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], was an American abolitionist, businessman, and sailmaker. He was born free to Thomas and [[Sarah Forten]] and attended Anthony Benezet's Quaker School for African American children. Forten began working as a sailmaker at the age of 14 after his father's death. He eventually became a foreman and later bought the sail loft when his boss retired. Forten's sailmaking business became highly profitable, employing both black and white workers. He was a founding member of the [[Free African Society]], established in 1787 under the leadership of [[Richard Allen 1]] and [[Absalom Jones]]. Forten was also involved in the [[Philadelphia]] [[Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which was the first integrated women's abolitionist organization. He passed away on March 4, 1842[1][2][3][4][5].
