Leader among the Maroons and venerated figure in Haitian Vodou François Makandal was a Haitian Maroon leader and a central figure in the resistance against slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. He is often described as a Vodou priest (houngan) or sorcerer (bókó) and is associated with the use of poison derived from natural plants to conduct a widespread plot against the slave owners. Makandal's movement caused great fear among the colonists and led to the deaths of many before he was eventually captured. Makandal's execution by burning at the stake on January 20, 1758, became legendary, with many of his followers believing he transformed into a mosquito or other creature to escape the flames, symbolizing his enduring spirit of resistance. His legacy is significant in Haitian history and culture, where he is often portrayed as a revolutionary forerunner to the Haitian Revolution and a symbol of slave resistance and marronage. The word "makandal" in Haitian culture retains meanings related to magic, secret societies, and amulets, reflecting his enduring impact
