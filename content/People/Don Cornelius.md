Beyond "Soul Train," Cornelius also ventured into other business endeavors, including launching a record label, Soul Train Records, and initiating the Soul Train Music Awards, further cementing his legacy in the music and entertainment industry. His contributions have been recognized with numerous awards and honors, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Cornelius's impact on music, television, and culture remains influential, and his legacy endures through the countless artists and audiences he inspired.
