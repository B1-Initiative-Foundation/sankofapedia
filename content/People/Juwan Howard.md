Juwan Howard is an American former professional basketball player and current head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team. As a player, Howard was recognized as a one-time All-Star and one-time All-NBA power forward. He began his NBA career as the fifth overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, selected by the Washington Bullets. Before his professional career, Howard was an All-American at the University of Michigan, where he was part of the famed "Fab Five" recruiting class of 1991 that reached the finals of the NCAA Tournament in 1992 and 1993. The Fab Five, which also included Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson, had a significant impact on the sport both on and off the court. Howard's son, Juwan Howard Jr., followed in his father's footsteps, playing high school basketball in Detroit and college basketball at Western Michigan and the University of Detroit. After a long NBA career, Howard transitioned into coaching and returned to his alma mater, Michigan, where he has continued to build a competitive program. He has led the Wolverines to success, including a Big Ten title and deep runs in the NCAA Tournament. Howard underwent successful heart surgery in September 2023 and is expected to fully recover. During his recovery, Phil Martelli served as the interim head coach
