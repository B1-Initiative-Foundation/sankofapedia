James Meredith is an American civil rights activist who became the first African American to attend the University of Mississippi, also known as "Ole Miss," in 1962. His enrollment followed a lengthy legal battle and was a pivotal moment in the American Civil Rights Movement. Meredith's admission to Ole Miss was met with violent opposition, leading to a riot on the campus that resulted in two deaths and numerous injuries. Federal troops were deployed to restore order and protect Meredith, who faced ongoing harassment during his time at the university. After graduating from Ole Miss, Meredith continued his education at Columbia Law School and remained active in the civil rights movement. In 1966, he initiated the "March Against Fear" from Memphis to Jackson to encourage African Americans to vote. Meredith was shot and wounded during the march, but the event was completed by other civil rights leaders and ended with a large rally in Jackson. Throughout his life, Meredith has been an advocate for individual rights and has authored several publications. His efforts to challenge segregation and promote civil rights have made him an important figure in American history
