## Brief Biography
[[Dr. Walter Rodney]], born on March 23, 1942, in [[Georgetown, Guyana]], was a Guyanese historian, political activist, and academic. He is best known for his groundbreaking work, "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa," which argued that the early period of African contact with Europe, including the slave trade, sowed the seeds for continued African economic underdevelopment. Rodney was an outstanding student who attended [[Queen's College]] in [[Guyana]] and later the University of the West Indies, where he graduated first in his class. He earned his PhD in African History from the School of Oriental and African Studies, [[London University]]. Rodney was also a founding member of the [[Working People's Alliance]], a political party in [[Guyana]]. Tragically, he was assassinated on June 13, 1980, at the age of 38[1][2][3][4][5].
