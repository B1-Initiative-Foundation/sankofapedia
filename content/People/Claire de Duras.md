Claire de Duras was a French writer known for her work "Ourika" (1823), which tells the story of a talented, lovely girl taken from Senegal and raised by an aristocratic French family[2]. The novel explores themes of racism and identity crisis, and it can be analyzed through Jacques Lacan's concepts of the Imaginary, the Symbolic, and the Real[2]. She also wrote "Édouard" (1825), which includes themes of social mobility and love, contrasting societal constraints with the freedom experienced during dance[4]. Additionally, she compiled "Pensées de Louis XIV" (1827), a collection of quotations from the memoirs of Louis XIV, portraying the monarch in a way that might appeal to post-Revolutionary society[5]. Her works contribute to discussions on gender, nationhood, and identity, as seen in the broader context of Romantic selfhood in the works of her contemporaries[6][7].
