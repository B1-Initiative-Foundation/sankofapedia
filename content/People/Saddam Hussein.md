Saddam Hussein was the President of Iraq from 1979 to 2003 and is known for his dictatorial rule. His presidency was marked by the suppression of political opposition, the Iran-Iraq War, the invasion of Kuwait, and conflicts with the United States-led coalition forces. Saddam's regime was characterized by the use of chemical weapons, human rights abuses, and the establishment of a personality cult. Saddam joined the Ba'ath Party in 1957 and played a key role in the 1968 coup that brought the party to power. He became increasingly influential in Iraqi politics, eventually becoming president in 1979. His rule saw the nationalization of Iraq's oil industry and attempts to position Iraq as a dominant force in the Arab world. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S.-led forces, Saddam was deposed and went into hiding. He was captured later that year and put on trial by an Iraqi tribunal for crimes against humanity. Saddam was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging, which was carried out in 2006. Saddam's legacy is controversial, with some viewing him as a leader who contributed to the development of Iraq's infrastructure and others condemning his brutal tactics and the suffering caused by his policies
