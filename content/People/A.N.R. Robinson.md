## Personal Life

Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson, born on December 16, 1926, in Calder Hall, Tobago, was the son of James Andrew and Isabella Muir Robinson. His early life was spent in Castara, a rural fishing village, where he attended the Castara Methodist Primary School. His father, a strict disciplinarian, served as the headmaster of his school. Despite his athletic endeavors in cricket, football, and track, Robinson excelled academically rather than in sports. His academic prowess earned him a Bowles Scholarship in 1938, allowing him to attend Bishop's High School in Scarborough, Tobago. Although he narrowly missed winning an Island Scholarship for university, he pursued higher education through the University of London's external program, graduating in 1951 with a Bachelor of Laws degree. He furthered his studies at St. John's College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics, and economics, graduating with honors(encyclopedia.com).

Robinson married Patricia Jean nee Rawlins, an economist, and together they had two children, David and Ann-Margaret. His hobbies included reading, walking, swimming, and music. Patricia Jean passed away in 2009(The Guardian).

## Career

Robinson's career was marked by significant contributions to Trinidad and Tobago's political landscape. He began his political journey as a founding member of the People's National Movement (PNM) and served as the country's first Minister of Finance after independence. However, disillusioned with the PNM's direction, he resigned in 1970 and founded the Action Committee of Dedicated Citizens, which later evolved into the Democratic Action Congress (DAC). As a leader of the DAC, he focused on advocating for Tobago's autonomy, which was realized with the establishment of the Tobago House of Assembly in 1980, where he served as its first chair[1].

In 1986, Robinson led the National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) to a landslide victory, becoming Prime Minister. His tenure was challenged by economic difficulties and the infamous 1990 coup attempt, during which he was held hostage and injured. Despite these challenges, he remained a steadfast advocate for democracy and the rule of law. In 1997, Robinson was elected President of Trinidad and Tobago, serving until 2003, and became known for his role in advocating for the establishment of the International Criminal Court.[2],[4]
## Achievements

Robinson's legacy includes his instrumental role in the creation of the International Criminal Court, a testament to his commitment to global justice and human rights. He was awarded the Order of the Caribbean Community (OCC) in 1998 for his contributions to the region's political emancipation and socio-economic well-being. Additionally, the A.N.R. Robinson International Airport in Tobago is named in his honor, recognizing his impact on both a national and international level.[2]
## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Robinson's presidency was not without controversy, particularly his decision to appoint Patrick Manning as Prime Minister following a tied election, which sparked debate about the extent of presidential powers in Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, his tenure as Prime Minister was marked by economic challenges and the 1990 coup attempt, which some critics argue could have been handled differently. However, these controversies do not overshadow his contributions to Trinidad and Tobago's democracy and his advocacy for international justice[5].
