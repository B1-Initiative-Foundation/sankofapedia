Jerome Adams is an American anesthesiologist and public health administrator who served as the 20th Surgeon General of the United States from September 2017 to January 2021. Before his tenure as Surgeon General, Adams was appointed by then-Governor Mike Pence as the Indiana State Health Commissioner, a position he held from 2014 to 2017. During his time as Health Commissioner, Adams dealt with several public health crises, including the largest HIV outbreak in Indiana's history, which was primarily driven by injection drug use. As Surgeon General, Adams focused on a wide range of public health issues, including the opioid crisis, tobacco addiction, maternal health, and the COVID-19 pandemic. He was known for his efforts to increase public awareness about the importance of carrying naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, and for his work to address health disparities and promote community health and wellness. Adams holds a unique position in the medical field, having continued to practice anesthesiology even while serving as Surgeon General. He has been a vocal advocate for public health, emphasizing the importance of preventive care and the need to address the social determinants of health. After his term as Surgeon General, Adams joined Purdue University as a Presidential Fellow and the Executive Director of Health Equity Initiatives, where he continues to work on improving health outcomes and equity across the United States
