## Personal Life

Abdul Hamid Muhammad Abdul Rahman al-Dbeibeh was born on February 13, 1958, in Misrata, a western city in Libya. His educational background includes a claim of earning a Master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Toronto in 1992, a claim that the university has denied[7][8]. This controversy emerged just before the Libyan elections scheduled for December 24, 2021, raising questions about the authenticity of his educational qualifications[9]. In Libya, a university degree from an accredited institution is a requirement for electoral candidates[8].

Dbeibeh is closely related to Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba, who was the mayor of Misrata and head of the state-owned development contractor LIDCO during the Gaddafi era. Ali Ibrahim Dabaiba was sanctioned in 2012, subject to an Interpol red notice, and arrested in 2014 for allegedly embezzling as much as $7 billion at 2011 rates from contracts issued under his leadership[10].

## Career

### Business Career

Upon returning to Misrata during a construction boom, Dbeibeh gained the trust of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, who appointed him as the head of the Libyan Investment and Development Company (LIDCO). This firm was responsible for some of the country's most significant public works projects, including the construction of 1,000 housing units in Gaddafi's hometown of Sirte[1]. After Gaddafi's fall in 2011, Dbeibeh faced sanctions for corruption by Libyaâ€™s new transitional government[10]. He also served as the manager of the Al-Ittihad Football Club[11].

### Political Career

In 2020, Dbeibeh founded the Libya al-Mustakbal (Libya Future) Movement and has been described as an independent[12]. He was elected as Prime Minister of Libya in February 2021 to lead a temporary unified executive, securing 39 votes, five more than his competitors Aguila Saleh Issa and Fathi Bashagha[13]. However, his election was marred by accusations of attempting to bribe delegates at the LPDF through his cousin, Ali al-Dbeibeh[14]. Despite these controversies, Dbeibeh's government marked the first unified government since 2014[12].

His tenure has been contested since February 10, 2022, when Fathi Bashagha was also selected as prime minister by the Libyan House of Representatives. Dbeibeh rejected Bashagha's appointment, stating he would only hand over power after a national election[17]. On February 10, 2022, he survived an assassination attempt[19]. The United Nations continues to recognize Dbeibeh as the interim prime minister[20]. In January 2024, he called for the restoration of the Libyan monarchy under Mohammed El Senussi as a solution to the country's instability.

## Achievements

Dbeibeh's significant achievement includes leading the first unified Libyan government since 2014, aiming to bridge the divisions within the country[12]. His efforts towards proposing the restoration of the monarchy to stabilize Libya further highlight his commitment to finding lasting solutions for the nation's political impasse.

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

Dbeibeh's career has been shadowed by controversies, including allegations of corruption, money laundering, and vote-buying. His claim of holding a Master's degree from the University of Toronto, which the university denied, added to the controversies surrounding his credibility[7][8][9]. Despite these allegations, his role in Libya's transitional political landscape remains significant[1].
