## Career
Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is the President of Egypt, having taken power in July 2013. His tenure has been marked by rapid development in various sectors, notably the energy sector. On July 24, he inaugurated three giant power stations, which are expected to support new residential and industrial clusters, such as the administrative capital city and Beni Suef zone. These developments are significant as they may boost Egyptian energy exports and allow for electricity exports to neighboring countries through existing and new grid links[2].

## Achievements
Under el-Sisi's leadership, Egypt has seen revolutionary changes in its foreign policy. The President introduced a multidimensional policy, reducing traditional dependence on the United States by diversifying suppliers for the armed forces with assistance from France and the Russian Federation. Economic ties with China and the EU countries were also expanded. The focus on the GCC monarchies, which provide significant financial assistance to Egypt, remains an important component of the country's foreign policy. However, challenges such as water shortages have forced Egypt to engage more actively with African states, particularly those in the Nile basin[5].
