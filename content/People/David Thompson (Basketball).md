David Thompson, often referred to as "Skywalker," is a former American professional basketball player renowned for his time with North Carolina State University (NCSU) and his subsequent professional career in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). Thompson led the NCSU Wolfpack to an NCAA championship in 1974, defeating the UCLA Bruins and ending their seven-year reign as champions. Thompson's collegiate career was marked by numerous accolades, including being named a three-time All-American. He was known for his incredible leaping ability, scoring prowess, and his role in one of the most memorable moments in college basketball historyâ€”the alley-oop dunk from Monte Towe, which helped change the game. After college, Thompson was selected first overall in the 1975 ABA Draft by the Denver Nuggets, where he had a stellar professional career, including winning the ABA Rookie of the Year and leading the Nuggets to the ABA Finals in his rookie season. He continued to excel after the ABA-NBA merger, earning multiple NBA All-Star selections and participating in the first-ever NBA Slam Dunk Contest in 1976.Despite his success on the court, Thompson's career was hampered by injuries and personal struggles, leading to an early retirement. However, his impact on the game and his high-flying style of play have left a lasting legacy, and he has been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
