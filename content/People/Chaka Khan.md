## Personal Life

Chaka Khan, born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953, in Great Lakes, Illinois, grew up in Chicago, Illinois, as the eldest of five siblings. During her teenage years, she and her sister Bonnie formed a singing group, The Crystalettes, with two friends from school. Khan's early exposure to music and the arts was further enriched by her involvement with the Afro-Arts Theater and another musical group she formed called the Shades of Black. In 1969, Khan became active in the Black power movement, joining the Black Panther Party and working with the organization's free breakfast program for children. It was during this time that she adopted the name Chaka Adunne Aduffe Yemoja Hodarhi Karifi. Khan dropped out of high school to pursue her musical career. She has been married twice and has two children, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan in 1970, which ended shortly after. Milini's birth was the result of a relationship between Khan and Rahsaan Morris. Khan's second marriage was to Richard Holland in 1976, which ended in divorce in 1980[3][2].
