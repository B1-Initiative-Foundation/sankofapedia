## Brief Biography
[[Phyllis Wheatley]], born around 1753 in [[Senegal]]/[[Gambia]], [[Africa]], was an American author and poet who is considered the first African-American woman to publish a book of poems. She was kidnapped at the age of eight and brought to [[Boston]] on an enslaved person ship. Upon her arrival, John Wheatley purchased her as a servant for his wife, Susanna. The Wheatleys educated Phyllis, and she soon mastered Latin and Greek, going on to write highly acclaimed poetry. She published her first poem in 1767 and her first book, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, in 1773. Wheatley married [[John Peters]], a free African American from [[Boston]], in 1778, and had three children, all of whom died in infancy. She passed away on December 5, 1784, in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]][1][2][4][5].
