## Nelson Mandela Biography

### Early Life and Education
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, South Africa, to the Madiba clan in the Xhosa-speaking Tembu people. After the death of his father, Chief Henry Mandela, young Nelson was raised by Jongintaba, the regent of the Tembu. Renouncing his claim to the chieftainship to pursue a career in law, Mandela attended South African Native College (later the University of Fort Hare) and studied law at the University of the Witwatersrand. He passed the qualification exam to become a lawyer and joined the African National Congress (ANC) in 1944, becoming a leader of its Youth League[1].

### Political Career
Mandela's political career was marked by his resistance to the apartheid policies of the ruling National Party. He played a significant role in the 1952 Defiance Campaign against South Africa's pass laws and co-founded South Africa’s first Black law practice in Johannesburg with Oliver Tambo. Mandela was a key figure in the ANC leadership, and after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960 and the subsequent banning of the ANC, he advocated for armed struggle and co-founded Umkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the ANC[1].

### Imprisonment
Mandela's anti-apartheid activities led to his arrest and imprisonment. In 1962, he was sentenced to five years in prison for leaving the country without a permit and inciting strikes. While serving this sentence, he was charged with sabotage in the Rivonia Trial and, in 1964, was sentenced to life imprisonment. He spent 27 years in prison, during which his reputation as a symbol of resistance to apartheid grew internationally. He was released in 1990, steadfastly refusing to compromise his political principles for freedom[1][3].

### Presidency
In 1994, following the first democratic elections in South Africa, Mandela became the country's first Black president. His presidency focused on dismantling the apartheid legacy and fostering national reconciliation. He established the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate human rights abuses and introduced initiatives to improve the living standards of the Black population. Mandela served one term as president and was succeeded by Thabo Mbeki in 1999[1][4].

### Later Years and Death
After retiring from active politics, Mandela continued to advocate for peace and social justice through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. He was also a founding member of The Elders, an international group of leaders working on global issues. Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013, in Johannesburg at the age of 95, leaving behind a legacy as a global symbol of resistance and reconciliation[1].

### Awards and Honors
Mandela received numerous awards and honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, which he shared with F.W. de Klerk for their efforts to end apartheid. His life and work have inspired countless individuals worldwide in the fight for human rights and equality[1].
