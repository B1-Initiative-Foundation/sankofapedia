Yahya Jammeh is a Gambian politician and former military officer who served as the President of The Gambia from 1996 to 2017. He first came to power in 1994, leading a coup d'Ã©tat that overthrew the government of Sir Dawda Jawara, subsequently establishing the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC). In 1996, Jammeh transitioned from military to civilian rule, winning the presidential election and founding the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC) political party. Jammeh's tenure as president was marked by accusations of human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and suppression of the press and political opposition. His government was also criticized for corruption and mismanagement. In December 2016, Jammeh lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow but initially refused to acknowledge the results, leading to a political crisis. Under pressure from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the threat of military intervention, Jammeh agreed to step down and went into exile in Equatorial Guinea in January 2017. Since leaving office, Jammeh has been accused of numerous crimes committed during his rule. The Gambian government announced plans to prosecute him for murder, rape, torture, and other alleged crimes. As of the latest updates, Jammeh resides in exile, and efforts to hold him accountable for his actions while in office continue
