Benito Mussolini, known as "Il Duce" (The Leader), was an Italian dictator who founded the Fascist Party in 1919 and ruled Italy as its fascist dictator from 1922 to 1943. Mussolini's early political life was marked by his role as a socialist journalist, but he broke away from the socialist party over its stance on Italy's participation in World War I. He then embraced nationalism and formed the Fascist Party, advocating for a totalitarian government. Mussolini's rise to power was characterized by the use of violence and intimidation by his Blackshirt militia, culminating in the March on Rome in 1922, which led to his appointment as Prime Minister by King Victor Emmanuel III. Once in power, Mussolini dismantled democratic institutions and established a dictatorship, promoting aggressive foreign policies and expansionist ambitions that led to Italy's involvement in World War II alongside Nazi Germany. His regime was marked by the suppression of political dissent, the promotion of fascist ideology, and the pursuit of Italy's imperial ambitions, notably the invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Mussolini's alliance with Adolf Hitler and participation in World War II ultimately led to his downfall. As the war turned against the Axis powers, Mussolini was deposed in 1943, rescued by German forces, and installed as the head of a puppet government in Northern Italy until he was captured and executed by Italian partisans in 1945. Mussolini's legacy is controversial; while he is remembered for his role in developing fascist ideology and leading Italy through a tumultuous period in history, his dictatorship is also associated with oppression, war, and the loss of democratic freedoms
