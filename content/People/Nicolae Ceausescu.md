Nicolae Ceaușescu was a Romanian communist politician and leader who served as the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 and as the President of Romania from 1974 until his overthrow and execution in 1989. His rule is often characterized by a cult of personality, draconian nationalism, a repressive regime, and an independent foreign policy that, while initially earning him a degree of international respect, eventually led to Romania's isolation. Ceaușescu's early political career was marked by his rise through the ranks of the Romanian Communist Party and his close association with older party leaders. After becoming the General Secretary, he initially introduced a series of liberalizing reforms but soon shifted towards increasing repression and control over Romanian society. His economic policies, particularly in the 1980s, led to severe shortages of food, medicine, and other essentials, drastically lowering living standards. Ceaușescu's attempt to repay foreign debts through exporting much of the country's agricultural and industrial production resulted in widespread poverty and malnutrition among Romanians. The Romanian Revolution in December 1989 led to Ceaușescu's rapid downfall. After a summary trial, he and his wife, Elena, were executed by firing squad on Christmas Day, marking a violent end to his 24-year rule and the last execution in Romania before the abolition of the death penalty.
