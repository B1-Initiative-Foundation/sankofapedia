Perri "Pebbles" Reid, known professionally as Pebbles, is an American singer-songwriter, businesswoman, producer, and music executive. She began her career as a backup singer and songwriter for groups like Con Funk Shun and Sister Sledge. Her self-titled debut album released in 1988 went Platinum and included the #1 hit "Mercedes Boy." Her sophomore album "Always" went Gold, featuring top ten hits like "Giving You the Benefit" and "Backyard" with Salt-N-Pepa. After marrying Antonio "L.A." Reid in 1990, she founded Pebbitone and managed the successful R&B group TLC. However, financial disputes led to TLC's bankruptcy filing in 1994 and the end of Pebbles' marriage to Reid. She started her own record label, Savvy Records, in 1993 and returned to her solo career in 1995 with the album "Straight from My Heart." Pebbles underwent a religious conversion in 1997, became an ordained minister, and founded "Women of God Changing Lives Through Christ." She returned to music in 2008 with a gospel album and continues to lead healing services in Atlanta, Georgia
