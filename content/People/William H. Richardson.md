William H. Richardson was an African American inventor who made significant improvements to the design of the baby carriage. On June 18, 1889, he patented his design in the United States, which was U.S. patent number 405,600. Richardson's design allowed the bassinet to be turned to face the operator or away, and it could be rotated on a central joint. A limiting device prevented it from rotating more than 90 degrees. Additionally, the wheels were designed to move independently, which greatly improved maneuverability. This innovation allowed parents or nannies to change the child's facing direction at will. Richardson's modifications to the baby carriage design have had a lasting impact, with many of his design elements still in use today[
