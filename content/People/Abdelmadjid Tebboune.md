## Career

Abdelmadjid Tebboune has played a significant role in Algeria's political and social landscape. His presidency has been marked by efforts to restore Algeria's role on the international stage and to address internal social and political crises following the Hirak protests and mobilizations of 2019-2020. Tebboune has utilized foreign policy as a tool for legitimacy, aiming to absorb public anger stemming from the excesses of Abdelaziz Bouteflika's four terms (1999-2019). He has introduced the concept of a "new Algeria," which is represented through a renewed foreign policy[3].

## Achievements

One of Tebboune's notable achievements is the establishment of a national day for imams in Algeria, in honor of Sheikh Sidi Mohamed Belkabir, a prominent Algerian scholar. This day, marked on September 15, reflects Tebboune's recognition of the importance of religious leaders in preserving Algerian national identity and contributing to the country's educational and spiritual life[2].

Under Tebboune's leadership, Algeria has also taken steps to increase its non-hydrocarbon exports, aiming for record levels that could reach 10 billion dollars by the end of 2022. This initiative is part of a broader effort to diversify Algeria's economy and reduce its dependence on oil and gas revenues[8].
