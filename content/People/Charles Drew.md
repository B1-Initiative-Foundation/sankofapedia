## Brief Biography
[[Charles Richard Drew]], born on June 3, 1904, in [[Washington, D.C.]], was an African American physician and surgeon who was an authority on the preservation of human blood for transfusion. He developed efficient ways to process and store large quantities of blood plasma, and during [[World War II]], he organized and directed the blood-plasma programs of the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]]. Drew resigned from his official posts in 1942 after the armed forces ruled that the blood of African Americans should be excluded from plasma donations. He then became a surgeon and professor of medicine at [[Freedmen's Hospital]] and [[Howard University]]. Drew passed away on April 1, 1950, near [[Burlington, North Carolina]], due to injuries sustained in an automobile accident[1][2][3][4][5].
