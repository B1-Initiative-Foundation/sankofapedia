John Albert Burr was an African American inventor who made significant improvements to the rotary lawn mower. Born in Maryland in 1848, Burr was a teenager during the Civil War and may have been enslaved until emancipation at the age of 17. He worked as a field hand during his teenage years but later attended engineering classes, thanks to the support of wealthy Black activists. On May 9, 1899, Burr patented an improved rotary blade lawn mower (U.S. Patent No. 624,749), which featured traction wheels and a rotary blade designed to prevent clogging from grass clippings. His design also allowed for mowing closer to building and wall edges, enhancing the functionality and efficiency of lawn mowers, Burr held over 30 U.S. patents for lawn care and agricultural inventions, including devices for mulching clippings, sifting, and dispersing them. His inventions contributed to labor-saving techniques and were beneficial for the health of the grass. Later in life, Burr enjoyed the commercial success of his inventions and received royalties for his creations. He was known to enjoy traveling and lecturing. Burr passed away in 1926 from influenza at the age of 78
