Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a Genevan philosopher, writer, and composer whose political philosophy influenced the Enlightenment across Europe, as well as aspects of the French Revolution and the development of modern political, economic, and educational thought. His notable works include "A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences," "The Social Contract," "Émile," and "Confessions," among others. Rousseau's ideas on the natural goodness of humanity, the corrupting influence of society, and the concept of the general will were revolutionary and have had a lasting impact on political theory and practice. His work also extended to music and literature, reflecting his belief in the importance of emotion and sentiment
