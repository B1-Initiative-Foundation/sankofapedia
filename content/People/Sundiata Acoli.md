## Legal Status
As of 2022, the New Jersey Supreme Court was weighing his release after the state’s parole board had again denied him parole. His conviction predates a law that sends convicted cop-killers to jail for life without parole, meaning that if he were convicted today, he’d die in prison, yet remains eligible for parole[1].
