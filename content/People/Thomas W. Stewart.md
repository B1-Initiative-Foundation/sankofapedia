Thomas W. Stewart was an African American inventor who made significant improvements to the mop, making it more efficient and user-friendly. On June 11, 1893, he was granted U.S. Patent No. 499,402 for his clamping mop design, which included a lever-operated wringer that allowed users to wring out the mop without getting their hands wet. This design also featured a detachable mop head, making it easier to clean and replace. Stewart's invention revolutionized the way people cleaned floors and is considered a precursor to modern mops. In addition to his work on the mop, Stewart also received a patent in 1883 for a station and street indicator used with railways and streetcars to signal what road or street the vehicles were crossing. Furthermore, he invented an improved metal bending machine in 1887 that was capable of oscillating, making the process of bending steel safer and more efficient
