Colin Kaepernick is a former American football quarterback and a prominent civil rights activist. He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). Kaepernick became widely known for his activism in 2016 when he began taking a knee during the national anthem before NFL games to protest racial injustice and police brutality. This act of protest sparked a national conversation and led to similar actions by other athletes across various sports. In addition to his activism on the field, Kaepernick co-founded the Know Your Rights Camp (KYRC), an organization aimed at advancing the liberation of Black and Brown communities through education on self-empowerment, mass-mobilization, and the creation of new systems that elevate the next generation of change leaders. KYRC has also established a COVID-19 Relief Fund and a nationwide Legal Defense Initiative. Despite his achievements on the field, including leading the 49ers to Super Bowl XLVII, Kaepernick has not played in the NFL since the 2016 season. His protest and activism have been met with both support and controversy, making him a polarizing figure in sports and beyond. Kaepernick has received several awards for his activism, including Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award
