## Personal Life

Sean Patrick Hannity was born on December 30, 1961, in New York City, to Hugh and Lillian Hannity, both of whom worked in the justice system. Growing up in Franklin Square, a Long Island suburb, Hannity was the youngest child and only son of first-generation Irish immigrants. His early education was in local Catholic schools. Hannity's academic journey included stints at Adelphi University, New York University, and the University of California-Santa Barbara, though he never completed his college education, opting instead to pursue a career in broadcasting[16].

Hannity married Jill Rhodes in 1993, and the couple has two children. Despite their divorce in 2019, they reportedly maintained a good relationship as co-parents[16][14].

## Career

Sean Hannity's broadcasting career began in 1989 at KCSB FM, a college radio station in Santa Barbara, California. His tenure there was short-lived due to controversy over his remarks about homosexuals, leading to his dismissal. However, this incident propelled him into positions at conservative AM stations WVNN in Athens, Alabama, and later WGST in Atlanta. In 1996, Hannity joined Fox News as the conservative co-host of *Hannity & Colmes*, alongside the more liberal Alan Colmes. After Colmes's departure in 2009, the show was renamed *Hannity*. Hannity also hosts *The Sean Hannity Show* on radio, which is syndicated on more than 500 stations in the United States[16][5].

Throughout his career, Hannity has been known for his conservative political commentary, often supporting Republican candidates and causes. He has been particularly supportive of Donald Trump, frequently defending his policies and actions on his shows[16][14].
