Charles Goodyear was an American inventor and self-taught chemist who is best known for developing the vulcanization process that made rubber durable and elastic, thus enabling its commercial use. His discovery was a significant milestone in the industrial use of rubber and had a profound impact on various industries, including the automotive industry with the development of rubber tires. .Goodyear began his career as a partner in his father's hardware business, which went bankrupt in 1830. He then became interested in rubber and dedicated himself to finding a method of treating it to make it more stable and less susceptible to temperature changes. After years of experimentation and financial hardship, including imprisonment for debt, Goodyear discovered the vulcanization process in 1839 when he accidentally dropped rubber mixed with sulfur onto a hot stove. Despite the success of his invention, Goodyear faced numerous patent infringements and legal battles to protect his work. He spent much of his life defending his patents, and although his invention made millions for others, he died with significant debts. Goodyear's legacy is honored by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, which was named after him posthumously when it was founded in 1898, although he had no direct connection to the company. Goodyear's contribution to the rubber industry is commemorated by the Charles Goodyear Medal, awarded by the ACS Rubber Division, and his induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. His work laid the foundation for the modern rubber industry, making products like tires, hoses, and countless other rubber goods possible
