Mahatma Gandhi, known as the "Great Soul" (Mahatma), was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British Rule. Internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress, Gandhi's philosophy influenced movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi's activism began in South Africa, where he lived for 21 years, advocating for the rights of Indian immigrants. Upon returning to India in 1915, he became a leader of the Indian National Congress and led nationwide campaigns for various social causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule. Gandhi was a key figure in the Indian independence movement, organizing the Salt March in 1930 in protest of the British salt monopoly, and later the Quit India Movement in 1942. His efforts contributed significantly to India gaining independence in 1947, although the partition of India into two dominions, India and Pakistan, deeply disappointed him. Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his belief in the equality of all people made him a global icon of peace and justice. His assassination in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist was a tragic end to his life, but his teachings and legacy continue to inspire people around the world
