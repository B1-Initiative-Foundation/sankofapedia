## Personal Life

Larry Bird was born in West Baden Springs, Indiana, on December 7, 1956. He grew up in the nearby town of French Lick, where he became a basketball legend for Springs Valley High School. Bird's family faced financial difficulties, which instilled in him a strong work ethic and determination. After high school, Bird received a scholarship to play college basketball at Indiana University. However, he left Indiana University shortly after joining and eventually transferred to Indiana State University in Terre Haute. It was at Indiana State where Bird's collegiate career flourished, leading the Sycamores to the NCAA championship game in 1979 against Michigan State University, a game that featured a legendary matchup with Magic Johnson.

## Career

Larry Bird's professional career began when he was selected by the Boston Celtics with the sixth overall pick in the 1978 NBA Draft. Bird played his entire professional career for the Celtics, from 1979 to 1992. During his time with the Celtics, Bird became one of the most dominant forwards in NBA history, known for his shooting accuracy, clutch scoring, and versatility. Bird led the Celtics to three NBA championships (1981, 1984, 1986) and was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) three times consecutively (1984, 1985, 1986). He was also a 12-time NBA All-Star and a member of the 50-40-90 club, highlighting his shooting efficiency. After retiring as a player, Bird served as a coach for the Indiana Pacers from 1997 to 2000 and then as the team's President of Basketball Operations.

Bird's rivalry with Magic Johnson, which began in college and flourished in the NBA, is credited with significantly increasing the popularity of the NBA in the 1980s.
