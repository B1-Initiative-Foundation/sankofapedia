## Personal Life

Larry Demetric Johnson was born on March 14, 1969. He became a prominent figure in basketball, known for his time as a power forward. Johnson's high school career was marked by his standout performance at Skyline High School in Dallas, Texas. He was a member of the 1987 McDonald's High School All-American Team. Despite initially committing to Southern Methodist University, Johnson began his collegiate career at Odessa College in Texas. His exceptional play there earned him the distinction of being the only player to win the National Junior College Athletic Association Division 1 Player of the Year award for both seasons he played[4].

## Career

Johnson's career at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) was nothing short of stellar. Under head coach Jerry Tarkanian, he played alongside future NBA players Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony. Johnson was instrumental in UNLV's victory in the 1990 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where they set records for the largest margin of victory and highest score in an NCAA Tournament championship game. Despite controversies surrounding the UNLV program, Johnson led the Runnin' Rebels to a perfect regular season record of 27â€“0 during the 1990-91 season[4][5].

After college, Johnson was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets as the first overall pick in the 1991 NBA Draft. He made an immediate impact in the league, earning accolades such as the NBA Rookie of the Year. Johnson's career was marked by his explosive playstyle, which, after a back injury, evolved into a more all-around game with an improved outside shot. He was traded to the New York Knicks, where he continued to be a key player and contributed to their 1999 Eastern Conference championship[4].

## Achievements

Johnson's achievements include being a two-time NBA All-Star and receiving the Naismith College Player of the Year, USBWA College Player of the Year, and John R. Wooden Award during his college career. He was inducted into the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 2014. His legacy at UNLV is commemorated with his induction into the UNLV Athletics Hall of Fame in 2002[3][4].

## Controversies, Myths, Misconceptions

While Johnson's career was largely celebrated, it was not without controversy. The UNLV program faced allegations of recruiting violations and misconduct, which led to an agreement with the NCAA that allowed the team to defend their title in the 1990-91 season but resulted in a suspension from post-season play the following year[4][5].
