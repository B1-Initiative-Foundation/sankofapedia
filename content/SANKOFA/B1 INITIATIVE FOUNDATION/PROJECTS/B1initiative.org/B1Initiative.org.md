# Notes
## CALL TO ACTION- Developers
Hey, I’m building a non profit technology start up. I’m looking for black developers to volunteer. The project will look great on our resumes, be useful to the Africans worldwide, and have the potential to make money once I start securing Grant money. I would like to **only** work with black people and in the future employ mostly brothers and sisters on the continent.  

**Our missions statement:**
*B1 Initiative Foundation employs Data Analysis to study racism while leveraging technology to empower communities within the African Diaspora.*

The website is currently a discord link:

https://www.b1initiative.org

We are a Pro-Black, Pan-African, Afrocentrist organization. Our goal is to bring awareness of African history and create opportunities for the next generation. 
There are a few projects I’m planning on doing, but the website is the most important because it will be our introduction to the world and help with the grants/donations. My goals for the site are:

1) Have the entire website display 3D ASCII art with Three.js. Kinda like the midjourney website. 
2) Create a blog for our daily Diaspora news updates. 
3) Create an email list for our newsletter
4) Create a page for publishing research reports called “blackpapers”

I plan on launching other exciting projects from this platform as well such as:

 A “Black Wikipedia” that can be a resource for people to look up our history and leaders

A Black GPT chatbot that can use the knowledge of the Black Wikipedia to answer questions about our history in the words of the scholars themselves. 

And a Black Wikileaks to help find and shame people that have discriminated, or acted racist against black people online. 

I also plan to collect data and cookies to market products from Africa to people all over the world. 

Let me know if you’re interested.
