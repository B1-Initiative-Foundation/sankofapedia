Émile Boga Doudou was an Ivorian politician and lawyer born in 1952 in Domaboué, near Lakota, Côte d'Ivoire. He was a founding member of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI) in 1982 and played a significant role in Ivorian politics until his death. Doudou served as the Minister of State for the Interior and Decentralization from 2000 until his assassination on September 19, 2002, during the early stages of the Ivorian Civil War[1][10].

Doudou's political career included being elected to the National Assembly, where he served as President of the FPI Parliamentary Group. He was a close ally of FPI leader Laurent Gbagbo, who became President after a controversial election in 2000. Doudou was re-elected to the National Assembly in the December 2000 parliamentary election and was also a Vice-President of the FPI[1][10][13].

His tenure as Interior Minister was marked by challenges, including a failed coup attempt in January 2001, where he announced on state radio that rebel forces had been routed[3]. Doudou was known for a controversial incident in which he displayed firearms on national television that had been seized by the armed forces[1][13].

Doudou's assassination occurred during a period of significant political and military turmoil in Côte d'Ivoire, which included the murder of other political figures and marked the beginning of the Ivorian Civil War[2][8][19]. His funeral was held on August 1, 2003, with a procession from a hospital morgue in Treichville, Abidjan, to the National Assembly, followed by a requiem mass at the Saint-Paul Cathedral in Plateau, and his burial in his hometown[1].
