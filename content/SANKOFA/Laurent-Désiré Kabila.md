Laurent-Désiré Kabila (1939–2001) was a Congolese revolutionary and politician who served as the third President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 17 May 1997 until his assassination on 16 January 2001[1]. He was born into the Luba tribe in the southern province of Katanga and studied political philosophy at a French university and attended the University of Dar es Salaam[6]. 

In 1960, Kabila became a youth leader in a political party allied to Congo’s first post-independence Prime Minister, Patrice Lumumba. After Lumumba was deposed by Mobutu and later killed, Kabila helped Lumumba supporters lead a revolt that was eventually suppressed in 1965 by Mobutu, who seized power later that year and renamed the country Zaire[6]. 

In 1997, Kabila led a rebellion against Mobutu Sese Seko, overthrowing him and becoming the self-proclaimed President of the renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo[2]. Despite the credit of a "liberator" he earned in overthrowing Mobutu, Kabila had the project of establishing a new authoritarian regime, which the Congolese people and their established elite had no sympathy for[2]. 

Kabila's presidency was marked by controversy and conflict. He was accused by many Congolese of having become a dictator who, in the eyes of some, was worse than Mobutu[2]. His government was also accused of civilian killings and impunity[10]. 

Kabila was assassinated in his office on January 16, 2001, by one of his bodyguards, who was then immediately killed[3]. His son, Joseph Kabila, succeeded him as president ten days later[1].
