Saif ad-Din Qutuz, often simply known as Qutuz, was a Mamluk Sultan of Egypt of Turkic origin. He was born in Persia and was captured by the Mongols during the fall of the Khwarazmian dynasty around 1231. He was then sold into slavery and taken to Damascus, and later to Egypt[1][9]. 

Qutuz is most famous for his victory over the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, which is considered a historical turning point[1][7][8]. This battle marked the first significant military defeat of the Mongols in the open field and halted their advance into the Islamic world[8]. 

Despite his victory, Qutuz did not enjoy his triumph for long. He was assassinated by a fellow Mamluk leader, Baibars, during a hunting expedition in Salihiyah while on his return journey to Cairo[1][6]. The circumstances surrounding his death are shrouded in mystery and intrigue, with many historians attributing his assassination to Baibars[2]. Following Qutuz's death, Baibars seized power, marking the beginning of his rule as the Sultan of Egypt[2]. 

Although Qutuz's reign was short, he is known as one of the most popular Mamluk sultans in the Islamic world and holds a high position. His name Qutuz means 'Vicious beast', a name he received because he fought like a vicious beast against other slave children[1][9].
