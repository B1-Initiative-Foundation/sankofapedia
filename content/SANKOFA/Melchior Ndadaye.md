Melchior Ndadaye (28 March 1953 â€“ 21 October 1993) was a Burundian politician and the first democratically elected President of Burundi, as well as the first president from the Hutu ethnic group. His presidency began on 10 July 1993 and was tragically cut short by his assassination on 21 October 1993, just a few months into his term. Ndadaye's death led to a devastating civil war in Burundi that lasted for a decade[1][2].

Born in the commune of Nyabihanga, Ruanda-Urundi, Ndadaye was the first of ten children in a Hutu family. His early life was marked by the Ikiza in 1972, a period when the government of Burundi targeted and massacred educated Hutus, which forced him to flee to Rwanda[1]. He later returned to Burundi and became involved in politics, eventually founding the Front for Democracy in Burundi (FRODEBU) party[4].

Ndadaye's election in 1993 was a significant milestone in Burundian history, representing a shift towards democracy after years of ethnic tension and Tutsi political dominance. However, his attempts to implement reforms and address the ethnic divide were met with resistance from Tutsi-dominated army factions[1][8].

The coup attempt on 21 October 1993, led by Tutsi soldiers, resulted in Ndadaye's assassination along with several cabinet ministers. This event sparked widespread violence and the civil war that followed claimed the lives of about 300,000 people[2][3]. The aftermath of his death saw a series of political upheavals and further assassinations, contributing to the prolonged instability in the country[5].

In 2020, Burundi's top court sentenced former President Pierre Buyoya and 18 others to life in prison for their involvement in Ndadaye's assassination, although many of those convicted, including Buyoya, were abroad and did not appear in court or enter a plea[3]. The assassination of Ndadaye remains a pivotal moment in Burundian history, symbolizing the deep-seated ethnic tensions and the challenges of transitioning to a stable democracy[1][2][3].
