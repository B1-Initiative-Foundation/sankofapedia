Idriss Déby Itno (18 June 1952 – 20 April 2021) was a central figure in Chadian politics and military affairs for over three decades, serving as the President of Chad from 1990 until his death in 2021. Born in the village of Berdoba, approximately 190 kilometers from Fada in northern Chad, Déby was a member of the Bidayat clan of the Zaghawa ethnic group. His early education included attending a Qur'anic School in Tiné, followed by studies at the École Française in Fada and further education in France, where he received military training[1][4].

Déby's ascent to power began in the military ranks of Chad's armed forces. He played a significant role in Hissène Habré's rise to power in 1982, eventually becoming the commander-in-chief of the Chadian army. However, his relationship with Habré soured, leading to Déby's exile and subsequent return at the helm of a rebel force that ousted Habré in 1990, marking the beginning of his long tenure as president[4].

Throughout his presidency, Déby faced numerous challenges, including coup attempts and rebellions. His leadership style was often described as autocratic, with his regime criticized for its lack of transparency and democratic governance. Despite these criticisms, Déby was reelected multiple times, most recently securing a sixth term just days before his death, in an election marred by allegations of parodying democracy[2].

Déby's death in April 2021 occurred under dramatic circumstances. He was killed while visiting troops on the frontline fighting rebels from the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT), who had advanced from Libya towards the capital, N'Djamena. His death was announced by the Chadian military, which stated that Déby had "breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"[3].

Following his death, a transitional military council led by his son, Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno, was established to govern the country. This move was seen by some as a continuation of Déby's legacy but was criticized by others as a military coup, bypassing the constitutional line of succession[3][6]. Mahamat Idriss Déby, also known as Mahamat Kaka, was born on April 4, 1984, and had previously served in high-ranking military positions, including as the second in command of the Chadian special forces in Mali[7][13].

Idriss Déby's rule and subsequent death have had significant implications for Chad and the broader Central African region. His leadership was marked by efforts to maintain stability in a tumultuous region, but his death has left a vacuum and raised concerns about the future of governance, democracy, and stability in Chad[2][15].
