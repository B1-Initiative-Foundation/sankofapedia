## Brief Biography
[[Jean Price-Mars]], born on October 15, 1876, in [[La Grande Rivière du Nord]], [[Haiti]], was a Haitian physician, public official, diplomat, ethnologist, and historian. He played a leading role in the development of human and social sciences and was a prominent figure in the Negritude movement, which prompted the revival of African cultural nationalism. Price-Mars authored more than one hundred books, articles, and speeches in the fields of anthropology, history, pedagogy, politics, and literature. His seminal work, "Ainsi parla l'oncle" (So Spoke the Uncle), has been published and translated into several languages. He served as Haitian chargé d'affaires in Washington, D.C. (1908–1911); national inspector of public education (1912–1915); and minister to France (1915–1916)[1][2][3][4][5].
