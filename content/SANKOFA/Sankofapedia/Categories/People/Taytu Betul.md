Empress [[Taytu Betul]] was the wife of [[Emperor Menelik II]] of [[Ethiopia]] and played a significant role in the political history of the country. She is known for her contributions during the [[Battle of Adwa]], where she mobilized troops, organized supplies, raised morale, gathered intelligence, nursed the wounded, and participated in the fighting, particularly during the [[Battle of Meqelle]][2]. Taytu was also involved in Menelik's efforts to unify [[Ethiopia]] and built up a personal following, gaining allegiance through dynastic marriages. Her influence was especially important during Menilek's illness, when it was said that it was "Taytu's forehead" that "held up the empire"[3]. Taytu's personality and subtle influence on events have secured her place among the notable women in Ethiopian history[5].
