## Legacy
[[Julius Kambarage Nyerere]] was a Tanzanian anti-colonial activist, politician, and political theorist who served as the first President of [[Tanzania]] from 1964 to 1985[1]. Born in Butiama, Mara, Tanganyika (now in Tanzania), Nyerere was an African nationalist and African socialist who promoted a political philosophy known as [[Ujamaa]][1]. He was a key figure in the struggle for Tanganyika's independence from British colonial rule and played a significant role in the formation of the [[United Republic of Tanzania]][1]. Nyerere's policies focused on national unity, self-reliance, and the development of education and healthcare[2]. Despite his commitment to socialism, Nyerere was known for his humility and did not enrich himself at the expense of his nation[2].
