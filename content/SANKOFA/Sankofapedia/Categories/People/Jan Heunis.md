Jan Heunis is known for his significant contributions during the final years of white rule in South Africa, particularly in the context of the National Party's negotiations with the ANC. He served as the Chief State Law Adviser in the State President's Office under PW Botha and played an influential role in the multi-party negotiations that led to the Constitution of 1996. Despite being born into the National Party and being the son of Constitutional Development minister Chris Heunis, Jan Heunis himself was not a politician but worked closely with South Africa's most powerful political figures, offering insights into the political dynamics of the time[2].
