Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo, also known as Khwezi, is remembered for her central role in a high-profile legal case in South Africa. She accused Jacob Zuma, the former President of South Africa, of rape in a trial that took place in 2006. The case and its aftermath highlighted significant issues regarding gender, race, and the treatment of sexual violence victims within the South African legal system and society. Redi Thlabi's book, "Khwezi: The Remarkable Story of Fezekile Ntsukela Kuzwayo," published in September 2017, brought renewed attention to her story, examining the societal and legal challenges she faced during and after the trial. The book and related discussions have contributed to ongoing debates about the notions of 'unrapeability' and the complex dynamics of gender and racial discrimination in the context of sexual violence[1][2].
