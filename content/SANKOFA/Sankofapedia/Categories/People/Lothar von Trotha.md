Lothar von Trotha is known for his role in Germany's genocide in Southwest Africa, specifically against the Herero people. His career, which spanned assignments to Germany's inner peripheries on the western and eastern borderlands, during the wars against Austria and France, in East Africa, and in China, has been largely ignored from the perspective of offering an explanation for his conduct in 1904 / 1905. However, he himself justified his decisions with explicit reference to previous experiences in other colonial contexts[1]. 

His 'Words to the Ovaherero people' – often referred to as the ‘extermination order’ (Vernichtungsbefehl), ‘firing order’ (Schiesbefehl) or ‘genocide order’ (Genozidbefehl) are crucial in the documentation of the Herero genocide[3][4]. 

Unfortunately, the search results do not provide more specific information about Lothar von Trotha's life, career, or specific contributions within the German Empire or other aspects of his life.
