## Legacy
[[Dedan Kimathi Waciuri]] was a Kenyan rebel field marshal who fought against the British colonial authorities during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]] in the 1950s[2]. Born in [[Thegenge village]], Nyeri, [[Kenya]], Kimathi became a significant member of the militant nationalist group, the [[Mau Mau]][1]. He was known for his elusiveness and was considered a dangerous terrorist by the British propagandists[1]. Despite this, Kimathi became a folk hero among the people of [[Kenya]][1]. After independence, several towns in Kenya named buildings or streets after him, and a statue was dedicated to him in [[Nairobi]] in December 2006[1]. Kimathi's life has inspired literary and historical works, such as "The Trial of Dedan Kimathi" by Ngugi wa Thiong'o and Micere Mugo, and "L'inafferrabile Mau Mau" (The Elusive Mau Mau) by Ottavio Sestero[1].
