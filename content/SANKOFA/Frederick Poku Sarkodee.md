Frederick Poku Sarkodee was a Ghanaian High Court judge who served from 1971 until his tragic death in 1982. He was born on August 26, 1927, in Assin Nsuta, Gold Coast (now Ghana), and was educated at Adisadel College. He was known for his judicial taciturnity, versatility, and commitment to fairness, hard work, and his family and God[1].

Justice Sarkodee was one of three High Court judges who were abducted and murdered on June 30, 1982, during the curfew hours in a period of political turbulence in Ghana. The other two judges were Mr. Justice Kwadjo Agyei Agyapong and Mrs. Justice Cecilia Koranteng-Addow. This heinous act was a significant event in Ghana's history, as it was seen as an attack on the judiciary and the rule of law[1][6].

The murders led to the establishment of a Special Investigation Board to investigate the incident. Five individuals were tried and found guilty for the murders, although one of the accused, Lance Corporal Amedeka, escaped from custody and was tried in absentia[10][13].

To honor the memory of the murdered judges, a memorial called the "Martyrs of the Rule of Law" was erected in front of the Supreme Court of Ghana buildings. The memorial serves as a reminder of the sacrifices made by these judges for the rule of law in Ghana[1][7].

Justice Sarkodee's legacy is remembered annually on Martyrs' Day, a day set aside to honor the judges and reaffirm the judiciary's commitment to independence and the rule of law[6][16].
