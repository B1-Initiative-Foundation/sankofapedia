### Career and Legacy

His report in June 1980 criticized the unwarranted use of ammunition by the police during a peaceful student demonstration[1].

### Personal Life
Agyapong was married to Mrs. Comfort Agyapong and was a father to 10 children, including Kwabena Agyapong, who later became a notable figure in Ghanaian politics[1].

### Tragic End
Justice Agyapong was one of the three judges abducted and murdered on June 30, 1982, a dark chapter in Ghana's history that shook the nation's judiciary. He, along with Justices Cecelia Koranteng-Addo and Frederick Opoku Sarkodie, as well as Major Sam Acquah, were labeled as "enemies of the revolution" by the then Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) led by the late former President Jerry John Rawlings. They were accused of being corrupt and biased, having adjudicated on high-profile cases involving the Peopleâ€™s Revolutionary Courts of the Armed Forces. Their abduction and murder were carried out by soldiers under the cover of darkness[2].

### Aftermath and Reflections
Kwabena Agyei Agyapong, the son of the late Kwadwo Agyei Agyapong, has publicly stated that he blames former President Rawlings and Kojo Tsikata for the murder of the judges, including his father. However, he holds no grudge against them, acknowledging the importance of protecting the nation's democracy and the rule of law[2].

In memory of the murdered judges, a memorial called the "Memorial to the Martyrs of the Rule of Law" stands in front of the Supreme Court of Ghana buildings[1].
