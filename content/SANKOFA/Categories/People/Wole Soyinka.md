Wole Soyinka is a renowned Nigerian playwright, poet, and essayist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986, becoming the first African laureate. He studied at the University of Leeds in the UK, where he began writing plays that drew on his Yorùbá heritage. His first major works, The Swamp Dwellers and The Lion and the Jewel, date from this period. In 1960, Soyinka received a Rockefeller Foundation grant to research traditional performance practices in Africa. His play A Dance of the Forest, a satire of the colonial elite, was chosen to be performed during Nigeria's independence festivities[1][3]. Specific details such as spouses, children, and parents' names for Wole Soyinka are not readily available in the public domain.
