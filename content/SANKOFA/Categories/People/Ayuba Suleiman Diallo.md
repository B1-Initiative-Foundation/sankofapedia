Ayuba Suleiman Diallo, also known as Job ben Solomon, was a native of Senegambia in West Africa. He was the son of a high priest and was kidnapped by his African enemy and sold as a slave in the New World in 1731. He worked on a tobacco plantation in Maryland. His literacy in Arabic attracted the attention of the philanthropist James Oglethorpe who helped to free him. In 1733, Job sailed to England and later returned to Africa. Upon Jobâ€™s request, Thomas Bluett wrote "Some Memoirs of the Life of Job the Son of Solomon" (1734)[3]. His story is considered one of the earliest biographies of any African-Americans[3]. His portrait was painted by the British painter William Hoare, a student of Thomas Gainsborough, making it one of only two portraits by major artists of the millions of men, women, and children carried on slave ships[4]. Further details about his biography, including his date of birth, education, family, and other affiliations, are not provided in the search results.
