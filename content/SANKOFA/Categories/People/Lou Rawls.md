[[Louis Allen Rawls]], known as Lou Rawls, was an American baritone singer, record producer, composer, and actor. He released 61 albums, sold more than 40 million records, and had numerous charting singles. Rawls was known for his smooth vocal style and his ability to adapt to jazz, soul, gospel, and rhythm and blues. He was also a high school classmate of music giant [[Sam Cooke]], and they sang together in the Teenage Kings of Harmony, a '50s gospel group. After graduating from Chicago's Dunbar Vocational High School, he sang briefly with Cooke in the Teenage Kings of Harmony, a local gospel group, and then with the Holy Wonders. In 1956, he stepped back from his burgeoning career to enlist in the army. After his discharge in 1958, he began to perform secular music. Rawls's debut album, Stormy Monday (1962), was a collection of jazz songs, but he did not have a hit single until the soulful “Love Is a Hurtin’ Thing” (1966), off his first rhythm and blues album, Soulin’. Rawls won three Grammy Awards during his career[2][3][4].
