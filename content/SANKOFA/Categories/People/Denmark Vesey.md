## Legacy
[[Denmark Vesey]] was a self-educated Black man who planned the most extensive slave rebellion in U.S. history in 1822 in [[Charleston]], [[South Carolina]][2]. Born in [[St. Thomas]], [[Danish West Indies]], Vesey was sold to a [[Bermuda]] slaver captain named [[Joseph Vesey]] and assumed the latter's surname[2]. He won his freedom in 1800 with $600 he had won in a street lottery[2]. Vesey's rebellion plan called for the rebels to attack guardhouses and arsenals, seize their arms, kill all whites, burn and destroy the city, and free the enslaved people[2]. As many as 9,000 Blacks may have been involved, though some scholars dispute this figure[2]. The plot was discovered before it could be implemented, and Vesey and his men were arrested[2]. Out of 131 men arrested and charged with conspiracy, 67 were convicted and 35 were hanged, including Vesey[5].
