[[Akhenaten]], also known as [[Amenhotep IV]], was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty who ruled from around 1353 to 1336 BCE. He is known for his religious revolution, in which he declared the sun disk, Aten, as the only god, marking a shift from Egypt's traditional polytheistic religion. This period of his rule is often referred to as the Amarna Period.
