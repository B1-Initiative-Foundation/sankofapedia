Born into slavery, she escaped to [[Philadelphia]] in 1849 and later returned to [[Maryland]] to rescue her family and other enslaved people[5]. Over the next decade, she conducted about 70 fugitive enslaved people along the Underground Railroad to Canada[5]. Tubman also served as a scout, spy, guerrilla soldier, and nurse for the Union Army during the [[Civil War]], making her the first African American woman to serve in the military[3]. After the war, she cared for the elderly in her home and established the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged on land near her home[3]. Tubman's legacy includes her courageous actions to free enslaved people, her service during the Civil War, and her advocacy for women's suffrage[1][3].
