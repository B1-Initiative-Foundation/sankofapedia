Augustine Tolton's struggle as a Black Catholic against discrimination in American society during the nineteenth century is highlighted in the biographies "From Slave to Priest" by Caroline Hamesath and "They Called Him Father Gus" by Roy Bauer. These works explore the actions Black Catholics, particularly Father Augustine Tolton, took to overcome discrimination from whites, the Catholic Church, and Black Protestants. His efforts had positive impacts, such as maintaining good relations among black and white Catholics, inspiring Black Catholics to continue their faith struggle, and leading to the establishment of Black Catholics' organizations[1].
