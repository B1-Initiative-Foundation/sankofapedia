## Brief Biography
[[Categories/People/Harriet Jacobs]], born in 1813 in [[Edenton]], [[North Carolina]], was an African-American abolitionist and writer. She was born into slavery, the daughter of two slaves, [[Delilah]] and [[Daniel Jacobs]]. Jacobs was taught to read and sew by her relatively kind mistress, [[Margaret Horniblow]]. After Horniblow's death, Jacobs was bequeathed to [[Mary Matilda Norcom]], leading to years of sexual harassment and abuse. To protect her children, Jacobs fled and spent seven years in hiding. Her children were bought by their father and later sent to the North. Jacobs escaped to the North in 1842, worked as a nursemaid in [[New York City]], and later moved to [[Rochester, New York]], to work in the antislavery reading room above abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]]â€™s newspaper, [[The North Star]]. Encouraged by her friend, Quaker reformer [[Amy Post]], Jacobs wrote her autobiography, "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself", which was self-published in 1861. The book detailed the sexual abuse of enslaved women and the anguish felt by enslaved mothers. After the [[Civil War]], Jacobs and her daughter did relief work in [[Savannah, Georgia]], and [[Edenton, North Carolina]]. She died in [[Washington, D.C.]] on March 7, 1897[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].
