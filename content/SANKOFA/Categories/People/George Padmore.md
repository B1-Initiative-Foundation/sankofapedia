## Legacy
[[George Padmore]] was a Trinidadian leftist political activist, author, and noted Pan-Africanist ideologue[3]. Born in [[Trinidad]], Padmore moved to the [[United States]] in 1925 to study at [[Fisk]] and Howard Universities[1]. He joined the [[American Communist Party]] in 1928 but left in 1934 due to disagreements with the party's political tactics[3]. Padmore then became a key organizer of Pan-African anti-colonial networks, strongly influenced by [[Marxism]][5]. He was a principal organizer of the Manchester [[Pan-African Congress]] in 1945, which helped lay the foundation for postwar African colonial liberation movements[1]. Throughout his life, Padmore's articles and essays were printed regularly in various newspapers, including the [[Chicago Defender]], the [[Pittsburgh Courier]], and The Crisis[1].
