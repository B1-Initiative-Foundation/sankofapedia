## Legacy
[[Bussa]] was a West African-born slave who led the largest slave revolt in Barbadian history, known as [[Bussa's Rebellion]], which took place from April 14 to 16, 1816[1]. Born in [[West Africa]], possibly of Igbo descent, Bussa was captured and sold to European slave traders, eventually being transported to Barbados in the late 18th century[1]. There are no earlier records of Bussa, and virtually no biographical information about him is available[1]. [[Bussa's Rebellion]] involved around 400 rebels, both men and women, most of whom were believed to be Creole, born in the islands[1]. Although the rebellion failed, its influence was significant to the future of Barbados[1]. In 1998, the Parliament of Barbados named [[Bussa]] as one of the eleven National Heroes of Barbados[1]. The Emancipation Statue, created by [[Karl Broodhagen]], was unveiled in Haggatt Hall, St. Michael, [[Barbados]], in 1985, and many Barbadians attribute the statue to Bussa, nicknaming it "Bussa's Statue"[1].
