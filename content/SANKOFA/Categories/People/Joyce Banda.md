Joyce Banda served as Malawi's first female president and was in office from April 2012 to May 2014. Her leadership was often discussed in the context of maternalism, and she faced significant scrutiny and gender-based stereotypes in media representations, particularly in editorial cartoons[1]. Banda and another female leader, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, were noted for their efforts to confront the neglect of maternal health and women's rights in their respective countries[2]. Despite the challenges, Banda's presidency was initially met with hope and enthusiasm, with expectations that her leadership would be transformative and attentive to the needs of the people[3]. However, her time in office was not without controversy, as her government faced corruption scandals[5]. In the 2014 elections, Banda lost the presidency, and there was a noted discrepancy between public opinion, which showed strong support for women's political rights, and the actual voting behavior that led to a reduction in women's representation in politics[6][7]. Joyce Banda's rise to power was significant in the context of Malawi's political history and her vision for the future of the country[8].
