## Brief Biography
[[James Armistead Lafayette]], born between 1748 and 1760 in [[New Kent County, Virginia]], was an enslaved African American who served as a spy during the [[American Revolutionary War]] under the Marquis de Lafayette. With the permission of his master, [[William Armistead]], James enlisted in the Continental Army and worked as a double agent, providing crucial information to the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] and disinformation to British commander [[General Cornwallis]]. After the war, Armistead petitioned for his freedom and was granted legislative emancipation in 1787. He later moved to a 40-acre farm in Virginia, where he married, raised a family, and lived as a free man until his death between 1830 and 1832[1][2][3][4][5].
