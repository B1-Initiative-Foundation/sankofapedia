## Contributions
Fannie Lou Hamer was an African American civil rights activist who led voting drives and co-founded the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]]. She was a powerful voice in the civil and voting rights movements, working to desegregate Mississippi and fighting for the rights of African Americans.

Hamer's early life was marked by poverty, and she began working in the cotton fields at a young age. Despite receiving only a sixth-grade education, she became a prominent figure in the civil rights movement, leading efforts to register African Americans to vote and advocating for political representation.

Hamer's activism led to her becoming a registered voter in 1963, and in 1964, she co-founded the [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]. She also testified before the credentials committee of the Democratic National Convention, demanding that the delegation of the Mississippi Democratic Party be replaced by that of the MFDP.

Throughout her life, Fannie Lou Hamer continued to be a tireless advocate for civil rights, even in the face of declining health. She passed away in 1977, leaving behind a legacy of courage and determination in the fight for equality.
