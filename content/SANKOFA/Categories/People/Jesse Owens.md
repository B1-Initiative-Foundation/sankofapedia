## Brief Biography
[[Jesse Owens]], born on September 12, 1913, in [[Oakville, Alabama]], was an American track and field athlete who won four gold medals at the 1936 Olympic Games in [[Berlin]]. His victories in the 100m, 200m, long jump, and 4x100m relay were a significant blow to Adolf Hitler's intention to use the Games to demonstrate Aryan supremacy. Owens' athletic career began in high school, and he continued to excel in track and field events while attending [[Ohio State University]]. After retiring from competitive sports, Owens engaged in boys' guidance activities, served as secretary of the Illinois State Athletic Commission, and worked in public relations. In 1976, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 1990, he was posthumously awarded the [[Congressional Gold Medal]][1][2][3][4][5].
