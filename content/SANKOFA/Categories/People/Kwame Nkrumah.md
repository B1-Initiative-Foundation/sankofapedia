## Legacy
[[Kwame Nkrumah]] was a Ghanaian nationalist leader, Marxist politician, political theorist, and revolutionary who led the Gold Coast's drive for independence from Britain and presided over its emergence as the [[Republic of Ghana]][1]. He was the first President of [[Ghana]] and served from 1960 to 1966, when he was overthrown by a coup[1]. Nkrumah was a prominent Pan-African organizer, and his radical vision and bold leadership helped lead Ghana to independence[3]. Under his leadership, Ghana experienced rapid industrialization, economic growth, and significant infrastructure development, including the construction of roads, schools, health facilities, and the largest man-made lake in the world, [[Lake Volta]] [2]. Nkrumah's legacy is celebrated in [[Ghana]] through the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day, which marks his 112th birthday[2].
