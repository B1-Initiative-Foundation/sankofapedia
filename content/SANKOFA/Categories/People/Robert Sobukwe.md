## Legacy
[[Robert Sobukwe]] was a South African black nationalist leader, founder and first President of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC)[3]. He was a strong believer in an Africanist future for [[South Africa]] and rejected any model suggesting working with anyone other than Africans[2]. Sobukwe organized and launched a non-violent protest campaign against pass laws, for which he was sentenced to three years in prison on grounds of incitement[2]. In 1963, the enactment of the "Sobukwe Clause" allowed an indefinite renewal of his prison sentence, and Sobukwe was subsequently relocated to [[Robben Island]] for solitary confinement[2]. At the end of his sixth year at Robben Island, he was released and placed under house arrest until his death in 1978[4]. Sobukwe's legacy is celebrated in [[South Africa]] through the annual Robert Sobukwe Memorial Lecture, which honors his contributions to the struggle for human rights and nonracialism[4].
