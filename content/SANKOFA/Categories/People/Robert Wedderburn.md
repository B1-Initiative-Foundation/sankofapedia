## Legacy
[[Robert Wedderburn]] was a British-Jamaican radical and abolitionist of multiracial descent active in early 19th-century London[1]. Born in Kingston, Jamaica, he was the illegitimate son of James Wedderburn Colvile, a Scottish sugar planter, and an African-born slave, Rosanna[2]. Wedderburn served in the Royal Navy before traveling to Britain in 1778[2]. He worked as a tailor and was involved in petty thieving before being licensed as a Unitarian preacher in 1813[2]. Wedderburn became increasingly involved in radical politics and was a vocal critic of the slave trade and the culture of Jamaican slavery[2]. In 1824, he published "The Horrors of Slavery," a stinging attack on his biological father and the culture of Jamaican slavery, which was widely circulated by the abolitionist cause[2]. His legacy as a political firebrand and key figure in Britain's history of race, religion, and revolution continues to be recognized[3][5].
