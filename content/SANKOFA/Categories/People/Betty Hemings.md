Betty Hemings was an enslaved woman owned by the Wayles and Jefferson families. She was the daughter of an African woman named Susanna and a white Englishman named John Wayles, making her the half-sister of Martha Wayles (who later married Thomas Jefferson). Betty Hemings had ten children, four with an unknown man and six with Wayles. Her children with Wayles included Mary, Martin, Betty Brown, Nance, Critta, and Robert Hemings. After Wayles' death, his daughter Martha inherited Betty Hemings and her children, and they were taken to Monticello, Jefferson's plantation. Betty Hemings' children held privileged positions in the Jefferson household. Her son James Hemings was trained as a French chef, and her youngest daughter, Sally Hemings, is widely believed to have had a long-term relationship and several children with Thomas Jefferson after his wife's death.
