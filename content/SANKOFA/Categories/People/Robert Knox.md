Robert Knox was a Scottish ethnologist and an anatomy lecturer. He was a leading member of the Ethnological Society of London. Knox is known for his work "Races of Man" (1850), a philosophical enquiry into the influence of race over the destinies of nations. He asserted that 'race is everything' and made significant contributions to Victorian racial thinking. Knox's theories of race were comprehensive in their explanatory reach, asserting that political and social explanations of intra-national and international conflict were redundant in the face of the determining, and unchanging, effects of racial difference and its equally natural corollary, racial antagonism[2][3].
