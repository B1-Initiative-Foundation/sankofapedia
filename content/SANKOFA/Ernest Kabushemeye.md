Ernest Kabushemeye was a Burundian politician who served as the Minister for Mines and Energy. He was also the leader of the Rally for the People of Burundi (RPB), a political party that was legalized in 1992[1][7][10]. Kabushemeye held several government positions and was known for his motto "Nturenganywe," which means "don't get your rights stomped on," reflecting his stance as a fighter for democracy[1][4].

Tragically, Kabushemeye was assassinated on March 11, 1995, an event that heightened ethnic tensions in Burundi[1][2]. His assassination occurred during a period of significant violence and political instability in the country, which was exacerbated by the influx of refugees from Rwanda and the increased armament of Hutu and Tutsi groups[2][3]. Kabushemeye's murder was part of a broader pattern of targeted killings, including the publication of "death lists" by extremist groups, which named individuals accused of opposing their ethnic or political agendas[3].

The assassination of Kabushemeye was a complex affair with multiple motives. As the Minister of Mines, he was involved in the so-called 'Gold Wars,' which involved competition over the trade of smuggled Zairian gold. It was rumored that Kabushemeye, identified as a Hutu hardliner, had links with Leonard Nyangoma and that part of the profits from the gold trade was financing the CNDD, a Hutu rebel group. This made him both a political opponent and a commercial rival to Tutsi extremists[11].

Kabushemeye's death was a significant event in Burundi's history, contributing to the cycle of violence and political turmoil that plagued the country during that period[6].
