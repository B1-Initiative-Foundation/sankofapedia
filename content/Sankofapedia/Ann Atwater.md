Ann Atwater was an American civil rights activist renowned for her work in Durham, North Carolina. She was a fierce advocate for the rights of poor African Americans and challenged the white power establishment in the 1960s. Atwater's activism began with her involvement in Operation Breakthrough, where she became a vocal proponent for better housing and educated citizens about their rights. She gained national attention for her role in the 1971 charrette to desegregate Durham's schools, where she worked alongside C.P. Ellis, a Klansman with whom she developed an unlikely friendship. Their story was depicted in the film "The Best of Enemies." Atwater continued her activism throughout her life, working with the poor and middle-class black community and mentoring young people. She passed away in 2016, leaving behind a legacy of fighting against racial injustice and poverty
