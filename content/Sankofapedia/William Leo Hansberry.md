William Leo Hansberry was an American scholar, lecturer, and pioneering Afrocentrist. He developed an early interest in ancient history and was influenced by W.E.B. Du Bois's book "The Negro." Hansberry's passion for African civilizations led him to pursue studies at Atlanta University and Harvard University. Despite facing challenges in his academic career, including accusations of teaching without adequate research and a delay in receiving tenure until 1938, Hansberry became a mentor to many African American and African students.He taught courses on African civilizations and cultures at Howard University and was internationally recognized as an outstanding scholar in his field. Among his notable students were Kwame Nkrumah and Nnamdi Azikiwe, who went on to become leaders of Ghana and Nigeria, respectively. Hansberry's work was so valued that Azikiwe offered to underwrite the publication of his research. Hansberry's legacy continues through the William Leo Hansberry Society, which promotes and diversifies the study of African civilizations
