James Edward Shepard was an influential African American pharmacist, educator, and businessman. He founded what became North Carolina Central University (NCCU) in Durham, North Carolina, initially as a private school for religious training in 1910. The institution evolved to focus on teacher education and later expanded into a liberal arts college, becoming the first state-supported liberal arts college for African Americans in the United States. Shepard was deeply involved in the African American business community in Durham and played a significant role in race relations during the segregation era. He remained the president of NCCU until his death in 1947, leaving a lasting legacy in education and African American empowerment
