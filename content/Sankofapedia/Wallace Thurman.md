Wallace Henry Thurman was an American novelist, editor, and playwright associated with the Harlem Renaissance. He is best known for his novel _The Blacker the Berry: A Novel of Negro Life_ (1929), which explores intra-racial conflicts related to skin color. Thurman's other notable works include _Infants of the Spring_ (1932), a satire of the Harlem Renaissance, and _The Interne_ (1932), co-authored with A.L. Furman. Despite his brief life, Thurman made significant contributions to African American literature, challenging the norms and expectations of his time. His work questioned and debunked the existence of a monolithic African American culture, offering instead a more nuanced and critical perspective on the complexities of black life in America
