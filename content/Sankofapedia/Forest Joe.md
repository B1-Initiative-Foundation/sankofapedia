He led a Lowcountry maroon band from 1821 to 1823, which posed a significant threat to the South Carolina slave society of the time. He was known for his maroon campaign in the Lowcountry, where he and his band attacked and pillaged nearby plantations. Forest Joe was killed on October 4, 1823, when a select party led by a slave named Royal managed to surprise and shoot him and three of his party members. His head was subsequently cut off and displayed as a warning to other slaves. His story is a testament to the resistance and resilience of enslaved people and has been recounted in historical works and podcasts, highlighting his significance in the history of slave resistance in America
