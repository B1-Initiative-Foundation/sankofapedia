## Legacy
[[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] was an American artist who rose to success during the 1980s as part of the Neo-expressionism movement[1]. He first gained attention for his graffiti under the name "SAMO" in New York[3]. Basquiat's work is characterized by a raw gestural style of painting with graffiti-like images and scrawled text[4]. His art often addressed personal angst, African American historical figures, and mixed motifs from African, Caribbean, Aztec, and Hispanic cultures with images from popular culture[4]. Basquiat collaborated with pop artist [[Andy Warhol]] in the mid-1980s, which resulted in a show of their work[3]. His legacy is celebrated through various institutions, including the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, which held an exhibition titled "Jean-Michel Basquiat: Now's the Time"[1].
