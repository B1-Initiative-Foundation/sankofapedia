She began teaching at the University of the West Indies in 1950 and was appointed Professor of West Indian History in 1961, a position she held until her death in 1980. Goveia published numerous significant works on slavery and West Indian history, including "Slave Society in the British Leeward Islands at the End of the Eighteenth Century" and "A Study on the Historiography of the British West Indies to the End of the Nineteenth Century."
