Cy Grant was a distinguished Guyanese actor, musician, writer, and poet. He served as a flight lieutenant in the Royal Air Force during World War II and was one of the few Caribbean aircrew members to survive the war. After the war, he became the first black person to be regularly featured on British television with his appearances on the BBC's "Tonight" show. Grant was also a founding member of the Drum arts centre in Birmingham, a hub for black British and British Asian arts. He was a prominent figure in the arts and a vocal advocate for civil rights, using his platform to address issues of race and colonialism. Grant passed away on February 13, 2010[1].
