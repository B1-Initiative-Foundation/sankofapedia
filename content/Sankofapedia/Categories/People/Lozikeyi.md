[[Lozikeyi Dlodlo]] was the senior queen of [[King Lobhengula]] and after his death, she became the Queen Regent of the Ndebele. She was an important political player in her own right, who was the moving spirit behind the War of the Red Axe (the [[Matabele Rebellion]]) in 1896. She subsequently encouraged the renaissance of the Ndebele nation through embracing western education and then turning it against the European settlers in what had become Rhodesia. After her death during the great 'flu epidemic of 1919, she remained an inspiration to Ndebele freedom fighters[1].
