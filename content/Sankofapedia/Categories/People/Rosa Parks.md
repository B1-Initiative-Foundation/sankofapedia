## Legacy
[[Rosa Parks]] is widely recognized as the "Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement". Her refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery city bus in 1955 sparked the [[Montgomery Bus Boycot]]t, a pivotal event in the Civil Rights Movement[8]. Parks' act of defiance and the subsequent boycott became powerful symbols of the movement against racial segregation. She was awarded the Martin Luther King Jr. Award by the [[NAACP]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], and the Congressional Gold Medal[3]. Parks continued to be an advocate for civil rights until her death in 2005, and her legacy continues to inspire and influence civil rights activism worldwide[2].
