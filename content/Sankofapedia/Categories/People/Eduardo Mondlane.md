## Legacy
[[Eduardo Chivambo Mondlane]] was a Mozambican anthropologist, political leader, and the first President of the Mozambican Liberation Front (FRELIMO) from 1962 until his assassination in 1969[2]. Born in [[Nwajahani]], [[Mandlakazi]], Portuguese Mozambique (now [[Mozambique]]), Mondlane was a key figure in the struggle for Mozambique's independence from Portuguese colonial rule[4]. He held the nascent FRELIMO organization together, obtained support from both communist and western European countries, and built a force of several thousand guerrillas whose strength lay in northern [[Mozambique]][4]. In 1975, the [[Universidade de Lourenço Marques]], founded by the [[Portuguese]] and given the name of the capital of Lourenço Marques (now Maputo, Mozambique), was renamed [[Universidade Eduardo Mondlane]], or [[Eduardo Mondlane University]], in his honor[2].
