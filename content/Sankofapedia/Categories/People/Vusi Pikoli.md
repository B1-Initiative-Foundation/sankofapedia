Vusi Pikoli is known for his role as the National Director of Public Prosecutions in South Africa. His suspension and subsequent dismissal by the President of the Republic of South Africa in 2007 and 2008 sparked a heated debate among legal scholars and political commentators. This debate centered around the extent to which the national prosecuting authority can freely exercise its prosecutorial powers in South Africa, highlighting concerns over political interference with the functions of an independent institution[1]. Pikoli's case is significant for understanding the constitutional limits of prosecutorial power in South Africa, raising important legal questions about the independence of the national prosecuting authority and its relationship with the political agenda[1]. Additionally, Pikoli was involved in an inquiry into the state of policing in Khayelitsha in the Western Cape, alongside Justice Kate Oâ€™Regan, which investigated the social context within which policing takes place[2].
