## Legacy
[[Sarah Ann Gill]] was a social and religious leader in [[Barbados]] during the era of slavery[1]. Born to a black mother and a white father, she was disqualified from meaningful participation in Barbadian society due to her African ancestry[1]. Despite this, she became influential in protecting religious tolerance on the island[2]. In 1998, the Barbadian Parliament named her a National Hero of Barbados[1]. The Ann Gill Memorial Church at Eagle Hall is named after her[1], and an annual "Sarah Ann Gill Memorial Lecture" has been given since 2007[1]. Many primary schools in Barbados now celebrate National Heroes Day in her memory[1].
