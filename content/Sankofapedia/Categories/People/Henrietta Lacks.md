## Legacy
[[Henrietta Lacks]] was an American woman whose cancer cells, known as HeLa cells, have been widely used in medical research since the 1950s[1][2]. HeLa cells were the first human cell line to be able to reproduce indefinitely, making them a valuable resource for researchers[4]. Lacks' cells have contributed to numerous scientific advancements, including the development of the polio and COVID-19 vaccines[5]. However, her cells were taken without her knowledge or consent, raising important bioethical issues and leading to changes in legal protections for research subjects[5]. Henrietta Lacks' legacy is celebrated through various institutions, including the [[Henrietta Lacks Foundation]], which supports individuals and families who have contributed to scientific research without their knowledge or consent[3].
