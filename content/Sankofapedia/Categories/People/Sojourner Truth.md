## Legacy
[[Sojourner Truth]] was an American abolitionist, women's rights activist, and speaker[1]. Born into slavery, she was freed in 1827 by the [[New York Gradual Abolition Act]] and worked as a domestic[2]. After her conversion to Christianity, she took the name Sojourner Truth, reflecting her new mission to travel and show people their sins and declare the truth[2]. She became an outspoken advocate for abolition, temperance, and civil and women's rights in the nineteenth century[3]. Truth is best known for her famous speech, "Ain't I a Woman?", which challenged the audience's beliefs about women and blacks being inferior[2]. She was the first African American woman to win a lawsuit, fighting for her son's freedom after he had been illegally sold[2]. In her life, she tirelessly advocated for the rights of African Americans, women, and numerous reform causes, including prison reform and against capital punishment[1]. She is memorialized in countless artworks, murals, and statues, and in 2009, Truth became the first Black woman memorialized with a bust in the U.S. Capitol[1].
