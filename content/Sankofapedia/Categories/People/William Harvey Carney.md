William Harvey Carney was an African American soldier during the American Civil War. Born into slavery, he gained his freedom through the Underground Railroad. Carney joined the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first official African American units in the United States during the Civil War. He is best known for his actions at the Battle of Fort Wagner, where he was credited with keeping the U.S. flag from touching the ground, despite being severely wounded. This act of bravery earned him the Medal of Honor in 1900, making him the first African American to receive this award. His actions at Fort Wagner were a significant symbol of courage and resistance for the African American community during the era of the Civil War.
