## Legacy
[[Henri Christophe]] was a key leader in the [[Haitian Revolution]] and the only monarch of the Kingdom of [[Haiti]][1][4]. He was born into slavery and eventually gained his freedom[3]. Christophe distinguished himself in the [[Haitian Revolution]], fighting alongside [[Toussaint Louverture]] and [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]][3]. He later proclaimed [[Haiti]] a republic nation and himself King, securing the title of Henri I, the first and only king of [[Haiti]][2]. He served as Haiti's king from 1811 to 1820, later becoming president in the last four years of his leadership[2]. Christophe is known for constructing the [[Citadelle Laferrière]], the [[Sans-Souci Palace]], the royal chapel of Milot, and numerous other palaces[4]. His policies of corvée, or forced labor bordering on slavery, earned revenues from agricultural production, primarily sugar, but the Haitian people resented the system[4].
