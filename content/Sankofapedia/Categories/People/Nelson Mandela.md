## Brief Biography
[[Nelson Mandela]], born on July 18, 1918, in [[Mvezo]], [[South Africa]], was a South African anti-apartheid activist, politician, and philanthropist who served as the first Black president of [[South Africa]] from 1994 to 1999. He was a key figure in the struggle against apartheid, a system of racial segregation and discrimination in [[South Africa]]. Mandela joined the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1944 and later co-founded the militant group Umkhonto we Sizwe. He was arrested and imprisoned for 27 years for his political activities, during which he became an international symbol of resistance to apartheid. Mandela was released in 1990, and in 1993, he and South African President F.W. de Klerk were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for their efforts to dismantle apartheid. In 1994, Mandela was elected the first Black president of [[South Africa]], serving until 1999. He passed away on December 5, 2013, in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]][1][2][3][4][5].
