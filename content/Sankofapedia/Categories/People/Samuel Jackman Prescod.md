## Legacy
[[Samuel Jackman Prescod]] was a Barbadian journalist, politician, and judge who became the first person of African descent to be elected to the Parliament of Barbados in 1843[2]. Born out of wedlock to a free colored woman, [[Lydia Smith]], and a wealthy white father, [[William Prescod]], he was given his forenames for [[Samuel Jackman]], a local white planter[2]. Prescod was a vocal advocate for the rights of the people and used his position as a newspaper editor to criticize the planters' policies that suppressed blacks[4]. In 1998, the Parliament of Barbados enacted that he should be styled as "The Right Excellent"[2]. The [[Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology]] and Jackmans, a town in the Saint Michael parish, are named in his honor[2].
