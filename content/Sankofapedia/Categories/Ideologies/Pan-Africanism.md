Pan-Africanism is a worldwide movement that aims to encourage and strengthen bonds of solidarity between all indigenous and diasporas of African ancestry. Based on a common goal dating back to the Atlantic slave trade, the movement extends beyond continental Africans with a substantial support base among the African diaspora in the Americas and Europe.

At its core, Pan-Africanism is a belief that "African people, both on the continent and in the diaspora, share not merely a common history, but a common destiny." Pan-Africanist intellectual, cultural, and political movements tend to view all Africans and descendants of Africans as belonging to a single "race" or otherwise sharing cultural unity. Pan-Africanism posits a sense of a shared historical fate for Africans in America, West Indies, and on the continent, itself centered on the Atlantic trade in slaves, African slavery, and European imperialism.

Pan-Africanism has a long and complex history, dating back to the early 19th century. Some of the earliest proponents of pan-Africanism were [[Martin Delany]], [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], and [[Marcus Garvey]]. These early pan-Africanists argued that Africans and their descendants should unite to fight against racism and oppression. They also believed that Africans should return to Africa to build a new nation.

In the 20th century, pan-Africanism became increasingly influential. The Pan-African Congresses, which were held in 1900, 1919, 1927, 1945, and 1958, were important forums for pan-Africanists to discuss their ideas and strategies. These congresses also helped to raise awareness of pan-Africanism around the world.

Pan-Africanism has had a significant impact on the history of Africa. It has helped to inspire African independence movements and has contributed to the development of pan-African institutions such as the [[SANKOFAPEDIA/Organization/Organization of Afro-American Unity]] (OAAU) and the African Union (AU). Pan-Africanism continues to be an important force in African politics and culture today.

Some of the key goals of pan-Africanism include:

- To promote unity and solidarity among Africans and their descendants.
- To fight against racism and oppression.
- To achieve self-determination and independence for African countries.
- To develop Africa economically and socially.
- To promote African culture and values.

Pan-Africanism is a complex and multifaceted movement, but it is ultimately a movement for the liberation and empowerment of Africans and their descendants.
