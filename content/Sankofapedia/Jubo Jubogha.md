Jubo Jubogha, who would later be known as King Jaja of Opobo, was born in 1821 in Umuduruoha, Amaigbo, in what is now Imo State, Nigeria. His early life was marked by turmoil as he was kidnapped and taken to Bonny Island, Rivers state, where he was renamed Jubo Jubogha by his first master. He was later sold to Chief Alali, the head of the Opobu Manila Group of Houses. Demonstrating exceptional business acumen and leadership skills, Jubogha rose to prominence in the complex political and economic landscape of the Niger Delta.In 1870, he founded the kingdom of Opobo, naming it after Opobo the Great, a Pepple king. As king, Jaja of Opobo became a significant figure in the palm oil trade in the Niger Delta, challenging European economic interests and asserting the sovereignty of Opobo against British colonial ambitions. His refusal to cease taxing British traders led to his arrest and exile by the British in 1887. Jaja was granted permission to return to Opobo in 1891 but died en route, allegedly poisoned. His death marked the decline of Opobo's power, but he remains a celebrated figure in Nigerian history for his resistance against colonialism
