Mohammed Ben Abu Bekr, known as Askia the Great, was a prominent ruler of the Songhai Empire, reigning from 1493 to 1528. He was not of royal blood and had no constitutional right to the throne, but he deposed Sunni Baru, the son of Sunni Ali, and claimed the title of Askia, which means "forceful one." Under his rule, the Songhai Empire experienced significant expansion and prosperity, becoming one of the largest empires in African history.Askia the Great was a devout Muslim and a patron of Islamic learning, recruiting scholars from Egypt and Morocco to teach at the Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu. He also established centers of learning in other cities like Gao, Djenn√©, and Walata. His administration was marked by astute governance, military alliances, and the promotion of Islam, including the enforcement of Islamic law and practices.In 1497-1498, Askia Muhammad performed the Hajj to Mecca, during which he was appointed the caliph of West Africa, a title with both religious and political significance. His pilgrimage and charitable acts in Mecca were designed to showcase the wealth and power of the Songhai Empire and to fulfill his religious duties.Despite his Islamic zeal, Askia Muhammad allowed religious freedom within his empire. He was eventually deposed by several of his sons in 1528, and the empire continued to be ruled by his descendants until its fall to Moroccan forces
