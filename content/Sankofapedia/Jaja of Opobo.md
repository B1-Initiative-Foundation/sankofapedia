King Jaja of Opobo (Jubo Jubogha) was born around 1821 in Umuduruoha, Amaigbo, in present-day Imo State, Nigeria. He was kidnapped and sold into slavery, ending up in the Bonny Kingdom, where he was renamed Jubo Jubogha. He later became a powerful political and military strategist, founding the prosperous city-state of Opobo in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria in 1870. Jaja was a thorn in the side of British imperial ambitions in southern Nigeria due to his successful monopolization of trade with the palm-oil producers and his insistence on independence from British control. Despite his efforts to modernize Opobo and maintain its sovereignty, he was tricked into exile by the British in 1887 and died in 1891 en route back to Opobo from exile. His legacy is celebrated in Opobo, where an imposing statue stands in his honor
