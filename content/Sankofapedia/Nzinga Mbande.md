Nzinga Mbande was a resilient and powerful ruler of the Ambundu Kingdoms of Ndongo and Matamba, located in present-day northern Angola. She was born into the ruling family of Ndongo, and her father was Ngola Kilombo Kia Kasenda. Nzinga is celebrated for her political and diplomatic acumen, as well as her brilliant military tactics. She was known for her ability to adapt and use her gender to her advantage in a society that was initially resistant to female rulers.Nzinga became queen after the death of her brother, Ngola Mbandi, and she distinguished herself as a sovereign by resisting Portuguese colonialist aspirations. She was a skilled negotiator and diplomat, forging strategic alliances and reforming the legal code of her kingdom. Nzinga also established contact with Christian rulers in Europe, hoping to certify Matamba's status as an internationally recognized Christian kingdom.During her reign, she adopted the masculine dress and mannerisms of an Imbangala warlord in wartime, but in the postwar era, she adopted new fashions, placed renewed focus on education, and abolished concubinage. Nzinga worked to increase the power of the royal family in Ndongo and managed to shape her state into a form that tolerated her authority.Nzinga remodeled her forces after the highly effective Imbangala warriors and waged a successful guerilla war against the Portuguese. She invaded the neighboring Kingdom of Matamba, capturing and deposing Queen Mwongo Matamba, and assumed the throne of Matamba herself. Nzinga continued to resist Portuguese influence and sought to develop Matamba as a trading power, dealing with the Portuguese colony on an equal footing until her death in 1663
