Andrew Johnson, a high school wrestler from Buena Regional High School in New Jersey, gained national attention in December 2018 when a video of him being forced to cut his dreadlocks before a match went viral. The referee, Alan Maloney, told Johnson that his hair and headgear did not comply with league regulations, giving him the ultimatum to cut his hair or forfeit the match. Johnson chose to have his hair cut and went on to win the match. The incident sparked widespread outrage and discussions about racial discrimination and the regulation of Black hair. It led to an investigation by the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights and the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association. The referee involved was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. The incident also contributed to broader legislative efforts to prevent discrimination based on hair, influencing laws like the CROWN Act in various states, which prohibits race-based hair discrimination
