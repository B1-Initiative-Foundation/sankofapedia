Shango was the fourth king of the ancient Oyo Empire, a significant cultural and political center for the Yoruba people. Oral tradition describes him as a powerful ruler with a voice like thunder and a mouth that spewed fire. After being challenged for the throne and feeling defeated, Shango left Oyo and committed suicide by hanging himself. However, his faithful followers claimed he ascended to the heavens on a chain, transforming into an orisha (deity). Shango is associated with thunder, lightning, and fire, embodying the natural forces and wrath of God. His most prominent ritual symbol is the oshe, a double-headed battle-ax, indicating his warrior essence and the slaying of enemies as his essential attributes. Shango's worship spread widely, becoming integral to the installation of Oyo's kings and influencing various cultures across Africa and the Americas
